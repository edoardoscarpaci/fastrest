varco_redis.stream_dlq
======================
Redis Streams-backed implementation of ``AbstractDeadLetterQueue``.

``RedisStreamDLQ`` uses a dedicated Redis Stream key
``{channel_prefix}dlq:stream`` with a consumer group for durable,
at-least-once pop + ack semantics — the same transport as
``RedisStreamEventBus``, so no new Redis topology is required.

Architecture
------------
::

    push()    → XADD {prefix}dlq:stream * {payload: <json bytes>}
    pop_batch() → XREADGROUP GROUP {group} CONSUMER varco-dlq-relay
                            COUNT {limit} BLOCK 0 STREAMS {key} >
    ack()     → XACK {key} {group} {stream_msg_id}
                XDEL {key} {stream_msg_id}   ← clean up acknowledged messages

DESIGN: entry_id ↔ stream message ID mapping
    ``DeadLetterEntry.entry_id`` is a UUID required by the
    ``AbstractDeadLetterQueue.ack(UUID)`` contract.  Redis Streams assign
    their own message IDs (e.g. ``"1704067200000-0"``) at XADD time.  These
    two ID spaces must be bridged.

    **Chosen approach**: an in-memory ``_pending`` dict mapping
    ``entry_id (UUID)`` → ``stream_msg_id (bytes)``, populated by
    ``pop_batch()`` and cleared by ``ack()``.

    Tradeoffs:
        ✅ ``DeadLetterEntry`` stays frozen — no field additions needed.
        ✅ Minimal complexity — one dict per DLQ instance.
        ✅ The ``ack()`` contract is satisfied: callers use the UUID they
           received from ``pop_batch()``.
        ❌ In-memory map is lost on process restart.  If the relay crashes
           between ``pop_batch()`` and ``ack()``, the messages stay in the
           PEL and are re-delivered on the next ``pop_batch()`` call (the
           consumer group reads them again via XREADGROUP).  Each re-delivery
           produces a new ``entry_id`` UUID for the same underlying stream
           message — this is acceptable because it is at-least-once semantics.
        ❌ Concurrent relay instances sharing the same consumer name would
           corrupt the map.  Use distinct ``consumer_name`` values per
           replica (default: ``"varco-dlq-relay"`` is a single-relay design).

    Rejected alternative: encode the stream msg ID as the ``entry_id`` UUID
        Using a deterministic UUID derived from the stream msg ID (e.g.
        ``uuid.uuid5(NAMESPACE_URL, msg_id_str)``) would eliminate the dict.
        Rejected because: callers expect ``DeadLetterEntry.entry_id`` to be
        a stable, opaque identifier, not an encoded transport address.  It
        would leak Redis stream internals into the public API.

DESIGN: dedicated stream key over re-using bus stream keys
    ✅ DLQ entries are operationally separate from live events — separate key
       makes it trivial to XLEN / XRANGE / XTRIM the DLQ without affecting
       live streams.
    ✅ Different retention policies can be applied (e.g. MAXLEN on the DLQ
       stream, long retention on live streams).
    ❌ One extra Redis key to monitor; negligible in practice.

DESIGN: consumer group over plain XREAD
    ✅ Enables at-least-once relay: messages unacknowledged due to a relay
       crash re-appear in the PEL (Pending Entry List) and are re-delivered
       on the next ``pop_batch()`` call.
    ✅ Consistent with ``RedisStreamEventBus`` — operators already understand
       consumer groups; no new mental model needed.
    ❌ Requires ``XGROUP CREATE`` before first ``pop_batch()`` — handled
       lazily and idempotently inside ``pop_batch()`` itself.

Serialization
-------------
``DeadLetterEntry`` is serialized to JSON using ``JsonEventSerializer``
(same format as ``RedisDLQ``) — the entire entry is stored in the ``payload``
field of each stream entry.

Key naming
----------
::

    {channel_prefix}dlq:stream    ← Redis Stream

Usage::

    from varco_redis.stream_dlq import RedisStreamDLQ
    from varco_redis.config import RedisEventBusSettings

    dlq = RedisStreamDLQ(settings=RedisEventBusSettings())
    await dlq.connect()

    await dlq.push(entry)              # XADD
    entries = await dlq.pop_batch()    # XREADGROUP (blocks until msgs arrive)
    await dlq.ack(entries[0].entry_id) # XACK + XDEL

    await dlq.disconnect()

Or as async context manager::

    async with RedisStreamDLQ() as dlq:
        ...

DI integration via ``RedisStreamDLQConfiguration``::

    from varco_redis.stream_dlq import RedisStreamDLQConfiguration

    container = DIContainer()
    await container.ainstall(RedisStreamDLQConfiguration)
    dlq = await container.aget(AbstractDeadLetterQueue)

Thread safety:  ❌ Not thread-safe — use from a single event loop.
Async safety:   ✅ All methods are ``async def``.

class RedisStreamDLQ(AbstractDeadLetterQueue):
    """
    Redis Streams-backed ``AbstractDeadLetterQueue``.

    Uses a dedicated stream key ``{prefix}dlq:stream`` with a consumer group
    for durable, at-least-once pop + ack semantics — the same transport as
    ``RedisStreamEventBus``, so no new Redis topology is required.

    ``push()`` appends to the stream via ``XADD``.
    ``pop_batch()`` reads unacknowledged messages via ``XREADGROUP``.
    ``ack()`` removes the message from the PEL via ``XACK`` and deletes it
    from the stream via ``XDEL`` to reclaim memory.

    Args:
        settings: ``RedisEventBusSettings`` — reuses the bus connection config.
                  DLQ keys are namespaced under ``{channel_prefix}`` to avoid
                  collision with bus channels.
        group:    Consumer group name.  All relay instances sharing the same
                  group load-balance consumption.  Defaults to ``"varco-dlq"``.
        consumer: Consumer identity within the group.  Must be unique per
                  replica if multiple relays run in parallel.  Defaults to
                  ``"varco-dlq-relay"``.

    Lifecycle:
        Call ``await dlq.connect()`` before use.  Call ``await dlq.disconnect()``
        when done.  Or use as an async context manager.

    Thread safety:  ❌ Not thread-safe.  Use from a single event loop.
    Async safety:   ✅ All methods are ``async def``.

    Edge cases:
        - ``push()`` NEVER raises — all exceptions are swallowed and logged.
          Callers (the retry wrapper) cannot recover from DLQ failures.
        - ``pop_batch()`` blocks up to 100ms if the stream is empty before
          returning an empty list.
        - The consumer group is created lazily on first ``pop_batch()`` call.
          ``BUSYGROUP`` errors (group already exists) are silently suppressed.
        - ``ack()`` on an unknown entry_id is a no-op — the ``_pending`` map
          simply won't contain it.
        - The ``_pending`` map is in-memory; it is lost on process restart.
          Unacked stream messages re-appear in the PEL and are re-delivered
          on the next ``pop_batch()`` call with a fresh ``entry_id``.

    Example::

        async with RedisStreamDLQ(RedisEventBusSettings()) as dlq:
            entries = await dlq.pop_batch(limit=5)
            for entry in entries:

            ✅ No DLQ entries are lost even if the relay starts after push().
            ✅ On restart (BUSYGROUP), the group already tracks its read position
