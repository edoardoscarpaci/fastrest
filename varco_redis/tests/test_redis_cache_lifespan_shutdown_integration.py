Plan 022 / Phase 4 (RL-8a), Step 25 — the orphan is *actually* torn down.

Steps 22–23 proved with unit tests that ``VarcoLifespan`` awaits its new
``shutdown=`` hook.  That is not the claim RL-8a makes.  The claim is that a
``@PreDestroy``-bearing singleton which is **not** a registered lifecycle
component — and which therefore leaked before this plan — now really releases
its resources.  Asserting "a hook was called" would restate Step 22; this file
asserts the *effect*, against a real Redis container.

``RedisCache`` is the worst confirmed orphan of the six measured in
``design/api-freeze-and-standards/measurements/predestroy-vs-lifespan.md``:
``RedisCacheConfiguration.redis_cache()`` (``varco_redis/cache.py:573-597``)
**awaits ``cache.start()``** inside the provider, so
``async_bootstrap(setup_cache=True)`` leaves a *started* connection pool bound
as ``CacheBackend`` that no lifespan path ever closed.

✅ **Fixed (Plan 024 / C2)** — resolved by adopting ``@Disposes``, not by an
upstream change. providify 2.0.1 (2026-09-01) settles the underlying dispatch
as **intentional** (Jakarta CDI producer-method rule): a ``ProviderBinding``
runs its ``@Disposes`` disposer and returns — the ``@PreDestroy`` on the
*instance a provider returned* is never reached, by design, and providify
2.0.1 documents this explicitly (`providify/README.md:945-949`) rather than
changing it. ``RedisCacheConfiguration`` now carries its own
``@Disposes(CacheBackend)`` method (``close_cache``, `varco_redis/cache.py`)
that calls ``RedisCache.stop()`` on ``ashutdown()`` — the assertions below
are now real, passing proof that the pool is actually closed. Same fix
shipped for ``MemcachedCache``
(`varco_memcached/tests/test_memcached_cache_disposes.py`).

See BACKLOG.md's C2 row and `plans/024-3-0-1-cleanup.md` §D-C2 for the full
resolution. The *positive* proof for a ``@Singleton``-bound (``ClassBinding``)
orphan — a structurally different shape — lives in
``varco_nats/tests/test_nats_lifespan_shutdown_integration.py``, against
``NatsStreamManager``, holding a real connection.

⚠️ Cross-package direction.  ``varco_redis`` does not (and must not) depend on
``varco_fastapi``; the import below is guarded by ``importorskip`` and the test
lives here only because the session-scoped ``redis_url`` fixture and the real
container do (CLAUDE.md's Test Conventions).  Nothing in ``varco_redis``'s
shipped code is involved in that import.

Per-test namespacing: the shared session container means this test confines
itself to a ``uuid4().hex[:8]`` key prefix it owns exclusively.

Thread safety:  N/A (integration test)
Async safety:   ✅ the lifespan is driven as an async context manager.

    A started-but-unregistered ``RedisCache`` has its socket closed at shutdown.

    Edge cases covered here on purpose:
        - The cache is asserted to be an *orphan* first (not in
          ``_collect_lifecycle_components()``), so the test cannot silently
          degrade into "a registered component was stopped".
        - The assertion is on the live ``redis.asyncio`` connection object, not
          on ``RedisCache._redis`` alone: a hook that nulled the attribute but
          leaked the socket would still pass a weaker check.
