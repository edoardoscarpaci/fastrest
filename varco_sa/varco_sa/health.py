===============
Health probes for the SQLAlchemy async backend.

Two probes are provided:

``SAHealthCheck``
    Liveness probe — borrows one connection from the engine pool, executes
    ``SELECT 1``, and releases the connection.  Tests that the database is
    reachable.  It does NOT create a throw-away engine — unlike the Kafka/Redis
    probes which create independent short-lived connections — because
    ``AsyncEngine`` creation requires sync imports and configuration that is
    already owned by the caller.  The probe borrows one connection from the
    existing pool for the duration of the check, which is the standard
    SQLAlchemy health-check pattern.

``SAPoolSaturationCheck``
    Pool-saturation readiness probe — takes a *synchronous* snapshot of the
    pool's counters via ``pool_metrics(engine)`` and returns ``DEGRADED`` when
    all connections are checked out.  This does NOT test database connectivity;
    it is purely about pool utilisation.  ``DEGRADED`` means the database is
    reachable but new requests may queue or fail waiting for a free slot.

DESIGN: borrow engine connection over throw-away engine (SAHealthCheck)
    ✅ No duplicate engine/pool creation — reuses the one already configured
       with SSL, pool size, auth, etc.  Throwing it away would recreate all that.
    ✅ ``SELECT 1`` via ``conn.execute`` is the canonical SQLAlchemy aliveness test —
       used by Alembic's ``env.py`` template and all major frameworks.
    ❌ A pool exhaustion scenario could cause ``check()`` to hang waiting for a
       connection slot — mitigated by ``asyncio.wait_for`` with the configured
       timeout.
    Alternative: ``engine.connect()`` with ``pool_timeout`` — rejected because
    pool_timeout is not available on all dialect/engine variants; wait_for is
    more universal.

DESIGN: sync pool_metrics snapshot in async check() (SAPoolSaturationCheck)
    ✅ ``pool_metrics()`` reads Pool attributes that are updated synchronously
       by SQLAlchemy's pool implementation — no I/O needed, always available.
    ✅ Taking the snapshot inside an async method does NOT block the event loop
       because no I/O or slow Python is involved; it is a handful of attribute reads.
    ❌ The snapshot is a point-in-time view — the pool state may change between
       the read and any action taken on the result.  Acceptable: health checks
       are advisory and sampled.
    Alternative: ``asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor`` — rejected as
    unnecessary overhead for attribute reads that complete in nanoseconds.

Thread safety:  ✅ Engine is thread-safe; connections are per-coroutine.
Async safety:   ✅ check() is async def; all I/O uses await; pool snapshot is
                   a read-only attribute access with no blocking I/O.

    Liveness probe for a SQLAlchemy-backed database.

    Borrows one connection from the engine's pool, executes ``SELECT 1``,

    Attributes:
        engine:  The shared ``AsyncEngine`` to probe.

        - If the engine pool is exhausted, wait_for will cancel the acquire
          attempt after the configured timeout and return UNHEALTHY.
        - ``SELECT 1`` works on PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and most others.
          For databases that don't support it (e.g. Oracle uses ``SELECT 1
          FROM DUAL``), subclass and override check() directly.
