"""
varco_core.reliability.preset
================================
``ReliabilityPreset`` — a frozen bundle of "opt into durability once" config
(Plan 009, Phase 9 / R5).

Composes three previously-separate concerns behind one object: retry+DLQ
(``varco_core.event``/``varco_core.resilience``), the transactional outbox
(``varco_core.service.outbox``), and the audit trail
(``varco_core.service.audit``) — plus the Phase 1 reliability metrics pack.

DESIGN: a frozen config object, not a `@Configuration`
    ✅ A scanned `@Configuration` auto-activates on `container.scan()`
       (`technical_docs/features/casbin-authorization.md`'s "Policy
       authorizer silently active" pitfall is the same class of mistake for
       a different feature) — durability silently turning on is as bad as
       it silently staying off.
    ✅ `create_varco_app(reliability=preset)` (Phase 9's fastapi wiring) is
       one explicit line.
    ❌ Not injectable-by-scan — that is the point.

DESIGN: the preset does not construct the DLQ
    ✅ The DLQ is backend-specific; `varco_core` must not know concrete
       types (the same layer rule as everywhere else in this codebase).
    ❌ Two lines instead of one at the call site — unavoidable given the
       layer rule.

    A named, composable bundle of reliability settings.

    Attributes:
        retry_policy: Applied to every bare ``@listen`` handler that neither
            declares its own ``retry_policy=``/``dlq=`` nor is overridden by
            an instance-level ``register_to(retry_policy=, dlq=)`` fallback.
        dlq:          Same scope as ``retry_policy`` — see
            ``EventConsumer.register_to()``'s resolution order.
        outbox:       Whether ``ReliabilityLifecycle.startup()`` should start
            an ``OutboxRelay``.
        audit:        Whether ``ReliabilityLifecycle.startup()`` should wire
            an ``AuditConsumer``.
        metrics:      Optional ``ReliabilityMetricsConfig`` — installed via
            ``install_reliability_metrics()`` at startup.
        outbox_max_attempts: Passed through to ``OutboxRelay`` verbatim.

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``outbox_max_attempts`` is set without a ``dlq`` —
            mirrors ``OutboxRelay.__init__``'s refusal to configure silent
            data loss (deleting a poison entry with nowhere durable to put
