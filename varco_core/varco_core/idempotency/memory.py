==============================
``InMemoryIdempotencyStore`` — the default, single-process
``AbstractIdempotencyStore`` implementation (Plan 029 / D1a, Step 3).

⚠️ **Single-process only.** Exactly the same warning
``InMemoryRateLimiter`` already carries: behind a load balancer with more
than one process/pod, each process sees its own reservations, so a retry
routed to a different instance would not observe the first instance's
in-flight reservation or completed record. Use ``RedisIdempotencyStore``,
``SAIdempotencyStore``, or ``BeanieIdempotencyStore`` for any
multi-process deployment. This store exists for local development, tests,
and single-process deployments where it is genuinely correct.

    Single-process ``AbstractIdempotencyStore`` backed by a plain ``dict``.

    Atomicity (§D-D1-atomic) is provided by a **lazily-created**
    ``asyncio.Lock`` guarding the whole dict — CLAUDE.md's rule that a lock
    must never be constructed at module scope or in ``__init__`` (it must be
    created inside a running event loop) applies here exactly as everywhere
    else in this codebase.

    DESIGN: one process-wide lock over a per-key lock
        ✅ Simple, and every operation here is O(1) dict access with no I/O
           — the critical section is microseconds long regardless of how
           many distinct keys are in flight, so a per-key lock would add
           complexity (a lock registry, its own cleanup) for no measurable
           benefit.
        ❌ A store handling many distinct concurrent keys serializes all of
           them through one lock. Acceptable: this store is explicitly for
           single-process/dev/test use, not high-throughput production.

    Thread safety:  ❌ Not thread-safe across OS threads — use from a single
                    event loop, same as every other in-memory varco_core
                    primitive.
    Async safety:   ✅ Coroutine-safe within one event loop via the lazily-
                    created lock.
