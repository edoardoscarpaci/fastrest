``IdempotencySettings`` — off by default (Plan 029 / D1a, Step 5).

Registered with a providify ``@Provider``, never ``@Singleton`` — pydantic
``BaseSettings`` subclasses accept a ``**values`` constructor providify
cannot inject positionally (CLAUDE.md's providify rule, same treatment as
``I18nSettings``/``CasbinSettings``).

    Configuration for ``IdempotencyMiddleware`` (§D-D1-optin, §D-D1-ttl).

    Attributes:
        enabled:                 Master switch. ``False`` (default) — no
                                  middleware behaviour; the plain pass-through
                                  path CLAUDE.md's "off by default" convention
                                  requires for every opt-in feature.
        ttl_seconds:              How long a completed record (and, before
                                  completion, its reservation) remains valid.
                                  Default ``86400`` (24 hours), following
                                  Stripe — the draft (brief 005 §1) leaves
                                  retention as a SHOULD-publish with no
                                  concrete number.
        require_key:              If ``True``, a ``POST``/``PATCH`` without
                                  an ``Idempotency-Key`` header is rejected
                                  with 400 rather than executed normally.
                                  Default ``False``.
        max_key_length:            Maximum accepted length of the
                                  ``Idempotency-Key`` header value. A longer
                                  (or empty) key is rejected with 400.
        max_stored_body_bytes:     Ceiling on a non-streaming response body
                                  size that will be captured for replay.
                                  Over this ceiling, the reservation is
                                  released and the response passes through
                                  unrecorded (§D-D1-replay) — deliberately
                                  the same behaviour as a streaming response.
        replay_header_allowlist:   Additional header names (beyond the
                                  hard-coded ``Content-Type``/``Location``/
                                  ``Content-Language``) that are replayed
                                  verbatim on a cache hit.

    Edge cases:
        - The draft this feature implements
          (``draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header-07``) expired
          2026-04-18 and was never published as an RFC — every place it is
          silent, these defaults follow Stripe's de-facto practice instead
          (§D-D1-ttl). Do not describe this feature as RFC-conformant.

    Thread safety:  ✅ ``VarcoSettings`` — immutable after construction
                    (frozen via subclass config, same as every other
                    settings class in this codebase).
    Async safety:   ✅ Pure value object — no I/O.
