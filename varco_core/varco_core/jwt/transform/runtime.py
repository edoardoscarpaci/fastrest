varco_core.jwt.transform.runtime
=====================================

Process-global, read-mostly registry resolution for
``varco_core.jwt.parser.JwtParser`` — the "no DI required" runtime path.

DESIGN: process-global registry instead of an injected instance
    ✅ ``JwtParser`` stays stateless classmethods — no breaking API change,
       no parser instances threaded through ``JwtBuilder``/``registry``/
       ``verify()`` call sites.
    ✅ Works with zero DI (library users, CLI tools, varco_core-only apps)
       via ``JwtTransformConfig.from_env()``.
    ✅ Zero-config cost is one dict lookup + ``IDENTITY`` (which returns the
       input dict as-is, no copy) — the hot path is unchanged.
    ❌ Mutable module state; two different mappings cannot coexist in one
       process.  Mitigated by the explicit ``transformer=`` parameter on
       ``parse()``/``_from_raw_claims()`` (always wins) and by
       ``reset_claim_transforms()`` in tests (autouse fixture,
       ``varco_core/tests/conftest.py``).
    ❌ Configuration is read at first-use, not at import — a late env
       mutation is picked up only on the *next* parse.  Call
       ``configure_claim_transforms()`` to force a rebuild immediately.
    Alternative considered: make ``JwtParser`` instantiable
    (``JwtParser(transformer=…)``).  ✅ pure, no globals.  ❌ breaks every
    existing ``JwtParser.parse(...)`` call site plus
    ``TrustedIssuerRegistry.verify()`` (which calls the classmethod
    ``JwtParser._from_raw_claims`` directly), and forces every non-DI
    caller to thread an instance through.  Rejected.
    No ``asyncio.Lock`` is used: the registry is set once at startup and
    only read afterwards; dict/attribute assignment is atomic under the
    GIL and the lazy init is idempotent (re-running it twice produces an
    equivalent registry).

Thread safety:  ⚠️ Module-global state — safe for the single-process,
                   mostly-read-after-startup usage pattern this targets.
                   Not designed for concurrent ``configure_*``/``reset_*``
                   calls from multiple threads.
Async safety:   ✅ No I/O, no awaits — safe to call from sync or async code.
