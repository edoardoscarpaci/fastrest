"""
varco_core.migration
=====================
Backend-agnostic migration contracts — ``AbstractMigrator``,
``SchemaMigrationPlan``, ``MigrationReport``, ``MigrationSettings``, the
migration exception hierarchy rooted at ``SchemaMigrationError``, and
``InMemoryMigrator`` (the standard unit-test double).

Nothing above the storage layer imports ``alembic`` or ``pymongo`` — those
live in ``varco_sa.migration`` and ``varco_beanie.migration`` respectively,
which both implement ``AbstractMigrator`` defined here.

**Renamed in 3.0.0 (Plan 022 / AB-2).** This package's ``MigrationError`` and
``MigrationPlan`` are now ``SchemaMigrationError`` and ``SchemaMigrationPlan``.
The old names still resolve here, to the *identical* objects, and emit a
``DeprecationWarning``; they are removed in 4.0.0. The rename exists because
the unrelated, older ``varco_core.migrator`` (domain data/field migration)
already owned both bare names at the ``varco_core`` top level, which forced
two deliberate re-export holes. Renaming the *newer, narrower* pair closes
them, so both concepts are now importable from ``varco_core`` directly and an
import site says which one it means.

See ``technical_docs/features/schema-migrations.md`` for the full guide.
