varco_core.event.dlq
=====================
Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) abstractions for the varco event system.

A DLQ receives events that a handler could not process after exhausting all
retry attempts.  Instead of silently dropping the event or crashing the
consumer, the event is persisted in the DLQ for later inspection, replay, or
manual intervention.

Architecture
------------
``AbstractDeadLetterQueue`` is the interface that backend packages implement:

    varco_core       AbstractDeadLetterQueue   ← THIS MODULE
                           ↑ implemented by
    varco_kafka      KafkaDLQ    (publishes to a dedicated DLQ topic)
    varco_redis      RedisDLQ    (publishes to a dedicated DLQ channel/stream)
    (in-process)     InMemoryDeadLetterQueue   (for tests)

Responsibility split
--------------------
- ``AbstractDeadLetterQueue.push()`` — called by the event consumer when a
  handler exhausts all retry attempts.  Stores the failed event entry.
- ``pop_batch()`` / ``ack()`` — used by a *DLQ relay* process (similar to
  ``OutboxRelay``) that replays DLQ entries or forwards them to monitoring.
  Backend implementations may choose not to support replay (e.g. a Kafka
  DLQ topic is self-contained — consumers read from it directly).

Usage in consumer (via ``@listen`` with ``dlq=``)::

    class OrderConsumer(EventConsumer):
        @listen(
            OrderPlacedEvent,
            retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=3),
            dlq=my_dlq,
        )
        async def on_order_placed(self, event: OrderPlacedEvent) -> None:
            await self._fulfillment_service.process(event)
            # If this raises after 3 attempts, event lands in my_dlq.

DESIGN: separate DLQ from the bus
    ✅ DLQ is a policy concern (per-handler), not an infrastructure concern
       (per-bus).  Different handlers on the same bus can route to different
       DLQ backends.
    ✅ ``AbstractDeadLetterQueue`` is independent of ``AbstractEventBus`` —
       no circular imports.
    ❌ Backend implementations (Kafka, Redis) must be instantiated and injected
       separately — slightly more wiring than a fully automatic approach.

Thread safety:  ⚠️ Implementations must document their own thread safety.
Async safety:   ✅ All interface methods are ``async def``.

    Immutable record of an event that failed all handler retry attempts.

    Carries both the original event (for replay) and metadata about the failure
    (for monitoring and debugging).

    DESIGN: frozen dataclass over Pydantic model
        ✅ No JSON serialization overhead for in-memory and test scenarios.
        ✅ Hashable — safe to use in sets for deduplication.
        ❌ Not directly JSON-serializable — backend implementations must convert

        ✅ ``maxlen`` parameter provides automatic eviction of oldest entries.
        ❌ No persistence — tests only.

    Thread safety:  ✅ ``asyncio.Lock`` protects all mutations.
    Async safety:   ✅ All methods use the lock — safe for concurrent coroutines.

    Attributes:
        max_size: Maximum number of entries before oldest are evicted.
                  Defaults to ``10_000``.

    Edge cases:
        - When ``max_size`` is reached, the oldest entry is silently dropped
          on the next ``push()``.  A WARNING is logged when eviction occurs.
        - ``pop_batch()`` returns and removes entries from oldest-first order.
        - ``ack()`` is a no-op since ``pop_batch()`` already removes entries —
          the in-memory implementation uses a simple consume-on-pop model.
