varco_core.event.serializer
============================
Serialization contract and JSON implementation for ``Event`` objects.

``Serializer[Event]`` (from ``varco_core.serialization``) is the contract that
defines how events are encoded to bytes for Kafka/Redis/NATS transport and
decoded back.  Bus backends annotate their ``serializer`` constructor parameter
with that interface, so any implementation can be plugged in via DI.

``JsonEventSerializer`` is the default implementation.  It subclasses
``Serializer[Event]`` explicitly (rather than relying on structural Protocol
satisfaction) so providify registers it under the interface, and carries
``@Singleton(priority=-sys.maxsize - 1)`` — the lowest possible priority, so it
is available out of the box but loses to any application-supplied serializer::

    @Provider(singleton=True)
    def my_serializer() -> Serializer[Event]:
        return MyCompactSerializer()

    container.provide(my_serializer)      # wins over JsonEventSerializer

⚠️ There is deliberately **no** ``EventSerializer`` type alias.  It previously
existed as a quoted forward reference (``EventSerializer: TypeAlias =
"Serializer[Event]"``), which bound the *string* to the module-level name at
runtime and made every ``EventSerializer | None`` annotation unevaluatable —
silently disabling DI for the parameter on all three bus backends.  Annotate
with ``Serializer[Event]`` directly.

The default implementation produces a flat
JSON object with an extra ``"__event_type__"`` key injected at the top level
to identify the event class during deserialization.

Serialization format
--------------------
::

    {
        "__event_type__": "entity.created",
        "event_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
        "entity_type": "Post",
        "pk": "abc123",
        "correlation_id": null,
        "payload": {"title": "Hello"}
    }

The ``Event`` subclass must have been imported (so ``__init_subclass__``
fires and the class registers itself) before ``deserialize`` is called.
In practice this means importing your event modules at application start-up,
which is normally done anyway for FastAPI / DI wiring.

DESIGN: flat JSON over nested envelope
    ✅ Human-readable in Kafka/Redis inspector tools.
    ✅ ``model_dump(mode="json")`` handles nested Pydantic types, datetimes,
       and UUIDs correctly — no custom encoding step needed.
    ❌ ``__event_type__`` is a reserved top-level key — event classes must
       not declare a field named ``__event_type__`` (it's a ClassVar, so
       Pydantic already ignores it, but the name collision must be avoided
       in the JSON payload).

DESIGN: instance methods over classmethods
    ✅ Satisfies the ``Serializer[Event]`` Protocol — Protocol methods are
       instance methods.  Classmethods would require a separate Protocol
       definition and break structural compatibility.
    ✅ Enables stateful serializers as drop-in replacements (e.g. a serializer
       that caches ``TypeAdapter`` instances).
    ✅ Consistent with ``JsonSerializer`` in ``varco_core.serialization``.
    ❌ Callers must hold an instance — the old classmethod API no longer works.
       Migration: replace ``JsonEventSerializer.serialize(e)`` with
       ``JsonEventSerializer().serialize(e)`` or inject an instance.

Thread safety:  ✅ Stateless — all instance state is read-only (TYPE_KEY).
Async safety:   ✅ No I/O — pure CPU-bound serialization.

# DESIGN: ``Event`` is imported at RUNTIME, not under ``TYPE_CHECKING``.
#
# ``Serializer[Event]`` is used as a DI binding interface and appears in bus
# constructor annotations as ``Serializer[Event] | None``.  Both uses require
# ``Event`` to be a real type object at runtime: a ``TYPE_CHECKING``-only import
# forces the reference to be quoted, and a quoted name evaluates to a ``str``,
# making ``… | None`` a TypeError that silently disables injection.
#
#   ✅ ``get_type_hints()`` (and therefore providify's binding validation) can
#      resolve every annotation mentioning ``Serializer[Event]``.
#   ✅ No import cycle: ``varco_core.event.base`` does not import this module.
#   ❌ Importing this module now also loads ``base.py`` — acceptable, since all
#      three bus backends already import ``base.py`` at module scope anyway.

#   ❌ Registers a binding even in apps that never use the event system (cheap:
#      the instance is only constructed on first resolution).

class JsonEventSerializer(Serializer[Event]):
    """
    Serialize and deserialize ``Event`` objects to/from UTF-8 JSON bytes.

    Uses ``Event._registry`` (populated by ``Event.__init_subclass__``) for
    type-safe deserialization without a separate registration step.  The event
    type name is embedded in the JSON as ``"__event_type__"`` so the class can
    be looked up without the caller providing a ``type_hint``.

    This class implements the ``Serializer[Event]`` Protocol, subclassing it
    explicitly so DI can bind it under that interface.  The ``type_hint``
    parameter of ``deserialize`` is
    accepted for API compatibility but ignored — the event type is always
    derived from the embedded ``"__event_type__"`` key.

    DESIGN: self-describing JSON via __event_type__ key
        ✅ No type hint needed at deserialization time — type is in the payload.
        ✅ Readable in any Kafka/Redis inspector tool.
        ❌ Every event class must be imported before deserialization — the
           ``__init_subclass__`` registry only fires on import.

    Thread safety:  ✅ Stateless — ``TYPE_KEY`` is a class-level constant.
    Async safety:   ✅ No I/O.

    Example::

        serializer = JsonEventSerializer()
        data  = serializer.serialize(my_event)
        event = serializer.deserialize(data)
        assert isinstance(event, type(my_event))
