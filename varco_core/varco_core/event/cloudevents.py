varco_core.event.cloudevents
=============================
CloudEvents v1.0.2 **structured-mode** envelope for ``Event`` objects.

This module ships a *second* implementation of ``Serializer[Event]`` — the seam
``varco_core/event/serializer.py`` already documents — so an application can put
every event it publishes inside a spec-compliant CloudEvents JSON envelope by
binding one object.  Nothing about ``Event``, the buses, the DLQ, the outbox or
the audit trail changes (Plan 022 §D-CE1, reserved-seams RS-1).

Opt in explicitly — never auto-active::

    from providify import DIContainer
    from varco_core.event.cloudevents import (
        CloudEventsSettings,
        bind_cloudevents_serializer,
    )

    container = DIContainer()
    bind_cloudevents_serializer(container, CloudEventsSettings(source="/svc/orders"))

or construct it directly and hand it to a bus::

    serializer = CloudEventsJsonSerializer(CloudEventsSettings(source="/svc/orders"))
    bus = KafkaEventBus(settings, serializer=serializer)

Wire format (structured mode, ``application/cloudevents+json``)::

    {
        "specversion": "1.0",
        "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
        "source": "/svc/orders",
        "type": "order.placed",
        "time": "2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
        "datacontenttype": "application/json",
        "correlationid": "corr-1",          # extension, only when the event has one
        "tenantid": "acme",                 # extension, best-effort — see below
        "data": {"order_id": "o-1", "total": 9.5}
    }

DESIGN: a second ``Serializer[Event]`` over changing ``Event``
    ✅ Zero change to ``Event`` — no field added, no ``model_dump()`` shape moved,
       so no DLQ / outbox / audit consumer sees a byte move.
    ✅ Zero change to any bus's *behaviour* — every bus accepts a ``serializer=``
       constructor kwarg and resolves ``Serializer[Event]`` optionally through DI,
       so binding is the whole opt-in on Kafka, NATS and both Redis shapes.
       (Redis needed one wiring fix to get there: its two implementations come
       from a ``@Provider``, and providify injects only what the provider *method*
       declares — see ``RedisEventBusSelectorConfiguration.bus()``.)
    ✅ Coverage is uniform across buses, all five DLQ backends and the outbox:
       each takes the serializer as a parameter rather than constructing
       ``JsonEventSerializer()`` as a literal, so dead letters and outbox rows are
       stored in the same wire format the bus publishes.
    ✅ Reversible per deployment: rebind and restart.
    ❌ A CloudEvents-serialized and a native-serialized event cannot share a
       channel mid-migration unless the consumer sniffs.  Mitigation is the
       three-phase dual-emit rollout in
       ``technical_docs/features/cloudevents-envelope.md``.
    Rejected — CloudEvents fields on ``Event`` itself: ❌ every event in every app
    changes shape and ``source`` has no correct process-wide default.
    Rejected — a per-bus ``cloudevents=True`` flag: ❌ three settings classes and
    three code paths duplicating a DI mechanism that already exists.

DESIGN: hand-rolled, **no** ``cloudevents`` SDK dependency (§D-CE3 / §D-N2-sdk)
    ✅ ``varco_core`` takes no new runtime dependency — the standing repo rule.
    ✅ The CNCF SDK carries its own "breaking changes possible with every update"
       disclaimer (research 005 §3); depending on it to avoid ~120 lines against a
       spec stable since 2022 is the wrong trade in both directions.
    ❌ varco owns spec compliance forever.  Mitigated: CloudEvents v1.0.2 is CNCF
       *Graduated* and new optional attributes arrive only in MINOR versions.

DESIGN: no module-level ``@Singleton`` / ``@Provider`` decorator
    ✅ ``container.scan("varco_core", recursive=True)`` is a documented, in-use
       pattern that auto-registers every decorated class *and every module-level*
       ``@Provider`` function (providify ``scanner.py:_scan_module``).  A decorator
       here would silently change the wire bytes of every app that scans
       ``varco_core`` — the exact opposite of §D-CE1's "opt-in, never auto-active".
    ✅ ``bind_cloudevents_serializer()`` registers at providify's **default**
       priority, which therefore beats ``JsonEventSerializer``'s
       ``priority=-sys.maxsize - 1`` in any registration order.
    ❌ One more wiring call for the adopter.  Accepted: an explicit call is the
       only honest way to say "change my wire format".

⚠️ **``tenantid`` is best-effort by design.**  It is read from
``current_tenant()`` — CLAUDE.md's single source of truth — and a serializer runs
on whatever task the publish happens on, so an ``OutboxRelay``-driven publish has
no ambient tenant and emits no ``tenantid``.  Do **not** "fix" this by adding a
tenant field to ``Event``.

⚠️ **Structured mode only.**  CloudEvents *binary* mode needs a header channel,
and ``AbstractEventBus.publish()`` is promised never to gain ``headers=``
(reserved-seams RS-2); binary mode arrives later through a separate
``MessageEncoder`` Protocol (§D-CE2).  A consequence is that the Kafka binding's
``content-type: application/cloudevents+json`` header is *not* set today — the
message body is spec-correct, the transport header is not reachable.

Thread safety:  ✅ Stateless apart from a frozen settings object.
Async safety:   ✅ No I/O — pure CPU-bound (de)serialization.  ``current_tenant()``
                   is a ``ContextVar`` read, correct on any task.

    ``source`` is **required and has no default**.  There is no correct default

# ── Opt-in DI wiring ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


def bind_cloudevents_serializer(
    container: DIContainer,
    settings: CloudEventsSettings,
) -> None:
    """
    Bind the CloudEvents serializer (and its settings) into *container*.

    This is the supported opt-in path.  Both registrations use
    ``container.provide()`` — a **provider**, never ``@Singleton`` — which is
    also the rule for any pydantic ``BaseSettings`` class (CLAUDE.md; providify
    cannot inject pydantic's ``**values`` constructor).

    After this call every bus that *resolves* ``Serializer[Event]`` gets the
    CloudEvents envelope, because the binding lands at providify's **default**
    priority and ``JsonEventSerializer`` is registered at
    ``priority=-sys.maxsize - 1``.

    Every bus resolves it: ``KafkaEventBus`` and ``NatsEventBus`` inject it as
    scanned singletons, and ``RedisEventBus``/``RedisStreamEventBus`` receive it
    from ``RedisEventBusSelectorConfiguration.bus()``, which forwards the binding
    explicitly (providify injects only what a ``@Provider`` method declares).
    The three ``@Configuration``-wired DLQs forward it the same way.

    Args:
        container: The DI container to mutate.
        settings:  Producer identity — construct it explicitly so a missing
                   ``source`` fails at wiring time, not at first publish.

    Returns:
        ``None`` — the container is mutated in place (``bind_*`` verb, see
        CLAUDE.md's DI wiring verb taxonomy).

    Edge cases:
        - Calling this twice registers two bindings; the last one wins at the
          same priority.  Call it once, at bootstrap.
        - It changes the **wire format** of every event the app publishes on a
          bus that resolves ``Serializer[Event]``.  Roll it out with the
          three-phase dual-emit plan in
          ``technical_docs/features/cloudevents-envelope.md``.
        - Dead letters follow the bus.  Each ``AbstractDeadLetterQueue``
          implementation re-serializes ``DeadLetterEntry.event`` with the
          serializer it was given, so a redrive republishes the same wire format
          the app publishes.  A DLQ populated *before* the swap still holds the
          old format — drain its backlog first (the feature doc's migration
          timeline covers the ordering).
        - ``SADeadLetterQueue`` and ``OutboxRelay`` are constructed by hand, not
          by a ``@Configuration``; pass ``serializer=`` explicitly to keep them
          in step with the bus.

    Example::

        container = DIContainer()
        bind_cloudevents_serializer(
            container, CloudEventsSettings(source="/svc/orders")
        )
    """
    serializer = CloudEventsJsonSerializer(settings)

    # `returns=` is providify's native interface override (>= 2.0.0) — required
    # because a lambda/closure has no useful return annotation to read.
    container.provide(lambda: settings, returns=CloudEventsSettings)
    container.provide(lambda: serializer, returns=Serializer[Event])
