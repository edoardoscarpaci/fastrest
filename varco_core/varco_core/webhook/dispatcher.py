varco_core.webhook.dispatcher
================================
``WebhookDispatcher`` — the delivery engine (Plan 031 / D4c, Step 12-13,
§D-D4-home, §D-D4-delivery).

⚠️ **Never holds ``AbstractEventBus``.** ``WebhookDispatcher`` is an
``EventConsumer``: it subscribes via ``@listen`` and is wired from
``@PostConstruct`` (or test code) via ``register_to(bus)`` — the one
sanctioned path CLAUDE.md carves out beyond ``OutboxRelay``/``DlqRedriver``.
Once registered, the dispatcher never touches ``bus`` again.

Retry model (§D-D4-delivery — reuse, invent nothing)
------------------------------------------------------
Delivery retries are driven by the **existing** ``varco_core.resilience.
RetryPolicy`` — the same primitive ``@listen(retry_policy=...)`` already
uses elsewhere in this codebase. This module does **not** use the generic
``@listen(retry_policy=..., dlq=...)`` wrapper mechanism, though: that
wrapper retries and DLQs the *whole handler invocation* once, which is the
wrong granularity here — one event can match **N** subscriptions, each of
which must be retried, disabled, and DLQ'd *independently*. Instead,
``register_to()`` is overridden to capture ``retry_policy``/``dlq`` as
instance state, and the ``@listen``-decorated handler runs its own
per-subscription retry loop, reusing ``RetryPolicy.compute_delay()``
directly rather than inventing a second backoff formula.

DESIGN: constructor default ``RetryPolicy`` is fast, not literally
Svix's seconds schedule
    §D-D4-delivery's documented *shape* is Svix's 8-attempt exponential
    schedule with jitter (immediate, 5s, 5m, 30m, 2h, 5h, 10h, 10h in
    Svix's real deployment). Reusing ``RetryPolicy`` gives the same
    *shape* (max_attempts, exponential backoff, jitter) but not
    arbitrary non-monotonic per-attempt seconds — ``RetryPolicy`` is a
    single exponential-with-jitter formula, and inventing a second,
    schedule-table-shaped retry primitive is exactly what §D-D4-delivery
    forbids ("no new reliability primitive invented").
    ✅ The shipped ``WebhookSettings`` defaults (``max_attempts=8``,
       small ``base_delay``) keep the *attempt count* Svix-shaped while
       keeping the unit test suite fast — a literal seconds-to-hours
       schedule would make every dispatcher test take hours.
    ✅ A production deployment moves the whole schedule with three env
       vars (``VARCO_WEBHOOK_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` /
       ``_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_SECONDS`` / ``_RETRY_MAX_DELAY_SECONDS``), or
       passes its own ``RetryPolicy`` — the "configurable" half of
       §D-D4-delivery's requirement.
    ❌ The literal numeric default here does not itself match Svix's
       real-world seconds — documented here explicitly so nobody mistakes
       it for a production-ready number.

Thread safety:  N/A — one dispatcher instance per process, no shared
                mutable state beyond the repository/dlq it is given.
Async safety:   ✅ All delivery logic is ``async def``. ``asyncio.sleep``
                is used for backoff — never blocks the event loop.

    Configuration flows from one place — ``WebhookSettings`` (env prefix
    ``VARCO_WEBHOOK_``). Every value it carries reaches the call site that
    needs it: the SSRF knobs are forwarded to ``validate_target()``, the
    replay-tolerance window to the constructed ``WebhookSigner``, and the
    retry/timeout/disable knobs become this dispatcher's defaults. The
    explicit keyword arguments below stay as per-instance **overrides** for
    a caller that wants one value different without building a whole
    settings object.

    DESIGN: settings object + explicit-keyword overrides
        ✅ ``VARCO_WEBHOOK_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP`` and friends actually take
           effect — before this, they were documented configuration that
           reached no call site, which is worse than no setting at all
           because an operator would believe the deny-list was extended.
        ✅ One source of truth: the settings docstring is the reference for
           every knob; nothing is configurable only via a constructor
           keyword and nothing only via env.
        ❌ Two ways to express the same value (settings field and keyword).
           Accepted because the precedence rule is one line — an explicit
           keyword always wins — and mirrors how ``RetryPolicy`` is already
           passed elsewhere in this codebase.
        Rejected — **settings-only, drop the keywords**: ❌ breaks every
        existing caller (including the test suite's
        ``disable_after_failures=1``) and forces a ``BaseSettings``
        construction, which reads the environment, into unit tests that
        want one number changed.

        repository:             The ``WebhookSubscriptionRepository`` to

                                 delivery outcomes.
        settings:                Delivery configuration. ``None`` (the
                                 default) constructs ``WebhookSettings()``,
                                 which reads ``VARCO_WEBHOOK_*`` from the
                                 environment.
        retry_policy:            Overrides the settings-derived retry
                                 schedule. ``None`` builds one from

                                 for why its default is Svix-*shaped* rather
                                 than Svix's literal seconds.
        request_timeout_seconds: Overrides ``settings.request_timeout_seconds``.
        disable_after_failures:  Overrides ``settings.disable_after_failures``.

        - The DLQ push on exhaustion never raises — same

          honour (CLAUDE.md).
        - ``settings=None`` reads the process environment at construction
