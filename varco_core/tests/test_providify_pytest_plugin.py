"""
Assert providify 2.0.0's ``pytest11`` plugin (``providify/pytest_plugin.py``)
is active with **NO** conftest.py change anywhere in this repo (Plan 016 /
RL-3d, Design §RL-3d, Step 31).

The plugin ships four function-scoped, yield-based, non-autouse fixtures —
``di_container``, ``di_acontainer``, ``di_overrides``, ``di_global`` — and
its own module docstring states the invariant this file locks in: *"a
project that never asks for [any of them] must see zero behavioural
difference from providify not being installed at all."*

varco deliberately does NOT re-export or wrap these fixtures from its own
testkit (Design §RL-3d) — this file exercises the plugin's fixtures
directly, requested by ordinary test functions, with no conftest.py in
this directory contributing anything.

Two of the fixture-interaction assertions (``di_overrides`` undone at
teardown, ``di_global`` restored at teardown) are proven by driving the
fixture generator functions directly via their ``__wrapped__`` attribute
(the plain Python generator function pytest wraps) rather than through a
full nested pytest run — this observes the exact same code path a real
test's fixture teardown executes, without the overhead/fragility of an
in-process pytest subprocess.

Thread safety:  N/A (unit tests)
Async safety:   ✅ ``di_acontainer``-related tests are ``async def`` — this
                   repo's ``asyncio_mode = "auto"`` picks them up with no
                   ``@pytest.mark.asyncio`` marker needed.
