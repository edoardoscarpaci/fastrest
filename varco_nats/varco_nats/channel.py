"""
varco_nats.channel
==================
NATS JetStream-backed ``ChannelManager`` implementation.

``NatsStreamManager`` administers the JetStream **stream** that backs the event
bus — creating it, purging per-channel messages, checking which channels carry
data, and listing them.  It is intentionally separate from ``NatsEventBus``
because stream administration may require broader credentials than a service
that only publishes and consumes events.

NATS channel model
------------------
Unlike Kafka — where each channel is a distinct topic — NATS channels are
**subjects under a single stream's wildcard**.  One JetStream stream
(``stream_name``) captures ``{subject_prefix}.>`` so every channel lives in it.

Consequences for this manager:

- ``declare_channel`` ensures the *backing stream* exists **and** records the
  channel in a process-local declaration registry (Plan 019 / RT2-C-contract
  — see ``NatsStreamManager``'s DESIGN block).
- ``channel_exists`` reports ``True`` if the backing stream exists AND the
  channel is either declared (registry) or currently carries a message
  (broker evidence) — the declared-or-present contract
  ``varco_core.event.channel.ChannelManager`` documents.
- ``list_channels`` enumerates the union of declared channels and subjects
  that currently carry messages.
- ``delete_channel`` purges a channel's messages from the stream **and**
  discards it from the registry.
- ``channel_has_messages`` (NATS-only, not on the ABC) preserves the old
  "subject currently carries a message" predicate under an honest name, for
  operational introspection.

Configuration
-------------
``NatsChannelManagerSettings`` uses the ``VARCO_NATS_ADMIN_`` prefix so admin
settings stay separate from the bus's ``VARCO_NATS_`` namespace::

    bus_config = NatsEventBusSettings(
        servers="nats://nats.internal:4222",
        durable_name="my-service",
    )
    manager_config = NatsChannelManagerSettings(
        servers="nats://nats.internal:4222",
        stream_name="varco-events",   # must match the bus
    )

DESIGN: separate from NatsEventBus
    ✅ Admin credentials never bleed into the bus.
    ✅ Services that only produce/consume events have no admin dependency.
    ✅ Infrastructure / migration scripts can use NatsStreamManager standalone.
    ❌ Two objects instead of one — justified by the privilege separation.

Thread safety:  ❌  Not thread-safe.  Use from a single event loop.
Async safety:   ✅  All public methods are ``async def``.

class NatsStreamManager(ChannelManager):
    """
    JetStream stream administration via the nats-py JetStream management API.

    Implements ``ChannelManager`` for NATS.  Because NATS channels are subjects
    under one stream's wildcard, the channel-keyed operations administer that
    single backing stream:

    - ``declare_channel`` → ensure the backing stream exists AND record the
      channel in the local declaration registry.
    - ``channel_exists``  → stream exists AND (declared OR carries a message).
    - ``list_channels``   → sorted union of declared channels and subjects
      that currently carry messages.
    - ``delete_channel``  → purge the channel's messages from the stream AND
      discard it from the registry.
    - ``channel_has_messages`` → NATS-only affordance preserving the original
      "subject currently carries a message" predicate.

    DESIGN: declaration registry + broker evidence (Plan 019 / RT2-C-contract)
        The ABC's ``channel_exists`` docstring requires the round-trip
        ``declare_channel(c)`` ⟹ ``channel_exists(c)`` is ``True`` until
        ``delete_channel(c)``. NATS has no per-channel broker object (every
        channel is a subject under one stream's wildcard), so — exactly like
        Redis's documented Pub/Sub registry (``varco_core.event.channel``'s
        own ``delete_channel`` Edge cases block already blesses this shape)
        — this manager tracks declared channels itself.
        ✅ Satisfies the ABC round-trip that a pure "has messages" predicate
           could not (the RT2-C bug this fixes).
        ✅ The ``OR carries messages`` half keeps today's operational value:
           a channel declared by *another* process becomes discoverable once
           it carries data, so ``list_channels()`` still reflects reality
           beyond this instance's own declarations.
        ❌ The registry is per-instance and process-local — a fresh manager
           in another pod reports ``False`` for a channel declared elsewhere
           that has never carried a message. Identical, and equally
           documented, limitation to Redis's ``ChannelManager``.
        ❌ Rejected — one JetStream stream per channel (a real broker object
           per channel, research 005 §E's suggested shape): a topology and
           wire-format change. ``stream_name`` is one shared stream with a
           ``{prefix}.>`` wildcard that the bus, the DLQ, and every existing
           deployment already share; splitting it per-channel changes
           retention/replica/dedup-window management from one object to N
           and breaks every existing stream. Rejected for this fix.

    Lifecycle:
        Must be started before any operation::

            manager = NatsStreamManager(settings)
            await manager.start()
            await manager.declare_channel("orders")
            await manager.stop()

        Or as an async context manager (preferred)::

            async with NatsStreamManager(settings) as manager:
                await manager.declare_channel("orders")

    Args:
        settings: Admin configuration injected from the container.

    Thread safety:  ❌  Not thread-safe.
    Async safety:   ✅  All public methods are ``async def``.

    Edge cases:
        - ``declare_channel`` is idempotent — an existing stream is left as-is,
          and re-declaring an already-declared channel is a no-op.
        - ``channel_exists`` returns ``True`` immediately after
          ``declare_channel``, even with zero messages published — the
          declared-or-present contract, not "carries data".
        - A channel this manager never declared, but that carries a message
          (published by another process, or before this manager started),
          still reports ``True`` — broker evidence supplements the registry.
        - ``stream_name`` / ``subject_prefix`` / ``channel_prefix`` MUST match
          the bus's values or the manager administers the wrong stream.
