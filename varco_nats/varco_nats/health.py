=================
Liveness probe for the NATS JetStream backend.

``NatsHealthCheck`` opens a short-lived NATS connection, confirms the server is
reachable and JetStream is enabled (via ``account_info()``), then closes the
connection immediately.

DESIGN: throw-away connection per check() call
    ✅ Tests real connectivity at call-time — a cached connection created at
       startup could appear alive while the server is currently unreachable
       (e.g. a NATS restart between health-check intervals).
    ✅ ``account_info()`` confirms JetStream specifically — a NATS server
       without JetStream enabled would pass a plain connect but fail the bus.
    ✅ No shared mutable state — safe to call concurrently from multiple tasks.
    ❌ Slightly higher overhead vs. reusing the bus connection.  Acceptable —
       health checks are infrequent and the connection is torn down at once.
    Alternative considered: expose the bus's internal connection — rejected
    because it would couple NatsHealthCheck to NatsEventBus internals.

Thread safety:  ✅ No shared state between check() calls.
Async safety:   ✅ check() is async def; all I/O uses await.

    Liveness probe for a NATS server with JetStream.

    Opens a throw-away connection on each ``check()`` call, queries JetStream
    account info to confirm real connectivity, then tears the connection down.

    Attributes:
        servers: Comma-separated NATS server URLs to probe.
        timeout: Seconds before the probe is abandoned and ``UNHEALTHY`` is
                 returned.  Default 5 s.

    Thread safety:  ✅ No shared mutable state.
    Async safety:   ✅ check() is fully async; connections are task-local.

    Edge cases:
        - check() NEVER raises — exceptions are caught and returned as
          ``HealthResult(UNHEALTHY, ...)``.
        - If the connection opens but JetStream is not enabled,
          ``account_info()`` raises and the probe reports UNHEALTHY.
        - The connection is always closed, even on failure, to avoid a
          dangling socket.
