varco_nats.dlq
==============
NATS JetStream-backed implementation of ``AbstractDeadLetterQueue``.

``NatsDLQ`` publishes failed event entries to a dedicated JetStream DLQ stream
and supports replay/monitoring via a durable pull consumer.

Architecture
------------
::

    Handler exhausts retries
        ↓
    dlq.push(DeadLetterEntry)
        → JetStreamContext.publish(subject="varco.__dlq__", payload=JSON bytes)

    DLQ relay / monitoring
        → pull consumer .fetch(batch=...) [durable: __varco_dlq_relay__]
        → pop_batch() returns DeadLetterEntry list
        → relay processes each entry
        → ack(entry_id) acknowledges the JetStream message

DESIGN: dedicated DLQ stream with WorkQueue retention
    ✅ JetStream persists entries durably — no data loss on relay restart.
    ✅ WorkQueue retention deletes a message the moment it is acked, so
       ``count()`` returns the EXACT number of pending entries — unlike the
       Kafka DLQ which cannot compute lag without an AdminClient and returns -1.
    ✅ ``push()`` is fire-and-forget (publish returns after the JetStream ack).
    ❌ WorkQueue retention permits only ONE consumer per subject — a single
       relay is supported.  Running multiple independent relays would require
       LIMITS retention and is intentionally not supported here.

Subject / stream naming
-----------------------
Default DLQ subject: ``{subject_prefix}.{channel_prefix}__dlq__``
Default DLQ stream:  ``{stream_name}-dlq``

Both can be overridden via constructor arguments.

Acknowledgement
---------------
``pop_batch()`` fetches messages WITHOUT acking — they remain in the stream
until ``ack()`` is called.  A relay crash between ``pop_batch()`` and ``ack()``
redelivers the entry (at-least-once relay semantics).

Usage (push-only, most common)::

    dlq = NatsDLQ(settings=NatsEventBusSettings(servers="nats://localhost:4222"))
    await dlq.start()

    # Wire into @listen — called automatically on retry exhaustion:
    class OrderConsumer(EventConsumer):
        @listen(
            OrderPlacedEvent,
            retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=3),
            dlq=dlq,
        )
        async def on_order_placed(self, event: OrderPlacedEvent) -> None:
            ...

    await dlq.stop()

Usage (with relay consumer)::

    async with NatsDLQ(settings=...) as dlq:
        entries = await dlq.pop_batch(limit=10)
        for entry in entries:
            await alert_ops(entry)
            await dlq.ack(entry.entry_id)

Thread safety:  ❌ Not thread-safe.  Use from a single event loop.
Async safety:   ✅ All methods are ``async def``.

class NatsDLQ(AbstractDeadLetterQueue):
    """
    NATS JetStream-backed ``AbstractDeadLetterQueue`` using a dedicated stream.

    **Push path** (primary use case): failed event entries are serialized to
    JSON and published to ``{subject_prefix}.{channel_prefix}__dlq__``.

    **Pop/ack path** (relay use case): a durable pull consumer fetches entries
    in batches; ``ack()`` acknowledges each processed message, which (under
    WorkQueue retention) deletes it from the stream.

    Args:
        settings:    NATS connection settings.  Defaults to
                     ``NatsEventBusSettings.from_env()``.
        dlq_subject: Full DLQ subject.  Defaults to
                     ``{subject_prefix}.{channel_prefix}__dlq__``.
        dlq_stream:  DLQ stream name.  Defaults to ``{stream_name}-dlq``.
        dlq_durable: Durable name for the relay pull consumer.  Defaults to
                     ``__varco_dlq_relay__``.

    Lifecycle:
        Call ``await dlq.start()`` before use, ``await dlq.stop()`` when done.
        Or use as an async context manager.

    Thread safety:  ❌ Not thread-safe.  Use from a single event loop.
    Async safety:   ✅ All methods are ``async def``.

    Edge cases:
        - ``push()`` NEVER raises — all exceptions are swallowed and logged.
        - ``pop_batch()`` waits up to 0.5 s for messages; an empty DLQ yields
          an empty list.
        - ``count()`` returns the EXACT pending-entry count (WorkQueue
          retention removes acked messages from the stream).
        - WorkQueue retention allows only one consumer — a single relay.

    Example::

        async with NatsDLQ(settings=NatsEventBusSettings()) as dlq:
            await dlq.push(DeadLetterEntry.from_failure(...))

            entries = await dlq.pop_batch(limit=10)

                print(f"DLQ: {entry.handler_name} failed — {entry.error_message}")

        WHY the no-predicate check runs first: the ABC's contract

        unbounded "delete everything" call with ``ValueError`` *before* a
        backend gets to say whether it supports predicate-based deletion at

        footgun the ABC exists to catch. This mirrors the sibling fix in

        Raises:
            ValueError: no predicate at all was given — refuses to silently
