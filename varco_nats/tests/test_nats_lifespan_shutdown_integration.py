Plan 022 / Phase 4 (RL-8a), Step 25 — the orphan is *actually* torn down.

Steps 22–23 proved with unit tests that ``VarcoLifespan`` awaits its new
``shutdown=`` hook.  That is not the claim RL-8a makes.  The claim is that a
``@PreDestroy``-bearing singleton which is **not** a registered lifecycle
component — and which therefore leaked before this plan — now really releases
its resources.  Asserting "a hook was called" would restate Step 22; this file
asserts the *effect*, against a real NATS container.

``NatsStreamManager`` (``varco_nats/channel.py:198``, ``@Singleton`` bound to
``ChannelManager``) is orphan #4 of the six measured in
``design/api-freeze-and-standards/measurements/predestroy-vs-lifespan.md``:
``create_varco_app()`` resolves only ``AbstractEventBus`` / ``AbstractJobRunner``
/ the two ``varco_ws`` buses as lifecycle components, never a ``ChannelManager``.
It is the strongest available proof because its ``@PostConstruct start()`` opens
a **real NATS connection** and its ``@PreDestroy stop()`` closes it — so
"released" is observable on the client socket, not merely on a private flag.

⚠️ **Why not ``RedisCache``, the measurement's "worst case".**  It is bound by
``RedisCacheConfiguration.redis_cache()``, a ``@Provider`` — and providify's
teardown runs ``@Disposes`` disposers for a ``ProviderBinding`` and only reaches
``@PreDestroy`` for a ``ClassBinding`` (``providify/container.py:4567-4576``).
So the ``RedisCache``/``MemcachedCache`` orphans are **not** fixed by this
adoption.  That is an upstream gap, filed as UPSTREAM-GAPS.md U-21 and pinned by
``varco_redis/tests/test_redis_cache_lifespan_shutdown_integration.py``'s strict
xfail — it is deliberately not worked around in varco code.

⚠️ Cross-package direction.  ``varco_nats`` does not (and must not) depend on
``varco_fastapi``; the import below is guarded by ``importorskip`` and the test
lives here only because the session-scoped ``nats_url`` fixture and the real
container do (CLAUDE.md's Test Conventions).  Nothing in ``varco_nats``'s
shipped code is involved in that import.

Per-test namespacing: the shared session container means this test confines
itself to a ``uuid4().hex[:8]`` stream name it owns exclusively.

Thread safety:  N/A (integration test)
Async safety:   ✅ the lifespan is driven as an async context manager.

    A started-but-unregistered ``NatsStreamManager`` has its socket closed.

    Edge cases covered here on purpose:
        - The manager is asserted to be an *orphan* first (absent from
          ``_collect_lifecycle_components()``), so the test cannot silently
          degrade into "a registered component was stopped".
        - The assertion is on the live ``nats.aio.client.Client``, not on
          ``NatsStreamManager._nc`` alone: a hook that nulled the attribute but
          leaked the connection would still pass the weaker check.
