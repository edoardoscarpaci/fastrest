varco_casbin.engine
===================
``CasbinPolicyEngine`` — the concrete policy backend.

Implements both halves of the ``varco_core.auth.policy`` seam by wrapping a
``casbin.AsyncEnforcer``:

    PolicyEngine.enforce(request)   → enforcer.enforce(sub, [dom,] obj, act)
    PolicyManagement.*              → enforcer.add/remove/get_named_policy + role API

One class, two interfaces — bound to both in DI so high-traffic service code
resolves it as ``PolicyEngine`` and the REST router as ``PolicyManagement``.

ABAC bridging (``_AttrStr``)
---------------------------
Casbin ABAC matchers read attributes off the request object
(``r.obj.owner_id``, ``"admin" in r.sub.roles``).  But RBAC/ACL matchers and
the role manager (``g(r.sub, p.sub)``) need ``r.sub`` / ``r.obj`` to behave as
plain *strings*.  ``_AttrStr`` is a ``str`` subclass that also carries the
attribute bag — so the SAME wrapped value satisfies both:

    - ``r.sub == p.sub`` / ``g(r.sub, p.sub)``  → string identity ✅
    - ``r.obj.owner_id``                        → attribute access ✅

This lets one engine serve ACL, RBAC, RBAC-with-domains, and ABAC models
without per-model branching in ``enforce``.

    A ``str`` that also exposes a mapping's entries as attributes.

    Used to pass Casbin a request subject/object that behaves as a plain
    string for ACL/RBAC matchers *and* carries ABAC attributes for
    attribute matchers — see the module docstring.

    Thread safety:  ✅ Effectively immutable after construction.
    Async safety:   ✅ Pure value.

    Edge cases:
        - An attribute name that collides with a ``str`` method (e.g. a field
          literally named ``"strip"``) would shadow that method on this
          instance.  Domain field names rarely collide; rename the field or
          add it to ``RequestMapper.object_attr_excludes`` if it does.
        - Missing attributes raise ``AttributeError`` exactly like a normal
          object — an ABAC matcher referencing an absent field fails closed.
        - ``__reduce__`` makes this class safe under ``copy.deepcopy``
          (Casbin's ``load_policy()`` deepcopies ``self.model`` internally,
          and once an ``_AttrStr`` has been threaded into the model/role-
          manager state via a prior ``enforce()`` call, an uninformed
          deepcopy would try to reconstruct it via ``cls(value)`` — missing
          the required ``attrs`` argument).  A field named literally
          ``"_attrs"`` would collide with the internal stash used for this
          and be overwritten; as with the method-name collision above, this
          is expected to be vanishingly rare for real domain field names.

    """
    Casbin-backed ``PolicyEngine`` + ``PolicyManagement``.

    Holds a single long-lived ``casbin.AsyncEnforcer`` built from the model
    (``CasbinSettings.resolve_model_text``) and the adapter
    (``build_adapter``).  Must be a **shared singleton** — a per-call engine
    would rebuild the enforcer and reload policy on every request.

    Lifecycle:
        ``start()`` (``@PostConstruct``) builds the enforcer and loads policy
        from the durable store.  ``stop()`` (``@PreDestroy``) is a no-op hook
        retained for symmetry / future connection cleanup.  The class is also
        an async context manager for non-DI usage.

    Thread safety:  ❌ Not thread-safe — the enforcer holds mutable policy.
                    Use from a single event loop.
    Async safety:   ⚠️ ``enforce`` is lock-free (read path); all *mutations*
                    are serialized by a lazily-created ``asyncio.Lock`` so
                    concurrent writes cannot corrupt enforcer state.

    Edge cases:
        - ``enforce`` before ``start()`` raises ``RuntimeError`` — fail closed.
        - With ``adapter="memory"`` there is no durable store; ``reload`` is a
          no-op and policy is lost on restart.
