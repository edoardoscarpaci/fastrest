varco_fastapi.tenancy.mount
==============================
``mount_tenant_admin()`` — the bundled-deployment opt-in for the tenant
provisioning admin surface (Plan 007, Phase 5, step 9 — RD-9).

DESIGN: ``mount_tenant_admin(app, ...)`` over a ``create_varco_app(tenant_admin=...)`` kwarg
    See the plan's "DESIGN: mount_tenant_admin(app, ...) over a
    create_varco_app(tenant_admin=...) kwarg" section for the full
    rationale. Summary: grep-able, matches the ``SkillAdapter.mount()`` /
    ``build_policy_router()`` precedents, and — the load-bearing point —
    **impossible to enable by environment alone**. There is deliberately no
    ``VARCO_TENANCY_MOUNT_ADMIN`` env var anywhere in this codebase
    (asserted by ``varco_core``'s settings tests and this module's own
    behaviour): an app that merely has ``VARCO_TENANCY_ADMIN_DSN`` set in
    its environment exposes **no** provisioning route until this function
    is called explicitly, with an explicit acknowledgement.

Three independent barriers against accidental bundling:
    1. ``acknowledge_bundled_admin`` defaults ``False`` -> ``ValueError``.
    2. ``server_auth`` is mandatory (no default) -> ``TypeError``/``ValueError``.
    3. No env-var path exists at all — this function is the *only* way to
       mount the router.

    Mount the tenant provisioning admin router into ``app`` — the
    explicit, opt-in "bundled" deployment shape (RD-9).

    Args:
        app:              The FastAPI app to mount into.
        control_service:  A ``TenantControlService``-shaped object.
        acknowledge_bundled_admin: Must be ``True`` — the friction is the
                          point (see module DESIGN note). Defaults ``False``
                          -> ``ValueError`` naming the standalone
                          alternative.
        server_auth:      Auth strategy. **Required.**
        admin_role:       Role required on every route. Defaults
                          ``"tenant-admin"`` — deliberately distinct from a
                          generic ``"admin"``.
        prefix:           URL prefix. Defaults ``"/tenancy"`` — a dedicated
                          prefix so an ingress can independently gate it.
        dependencies:     Extra FastAPI dependencies applied to every
                          mounted route (e.g. an IP allowlist, an mTLS
                          check) — a network-level gate independent of the
                          role guard.

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``acknowledge_bundled_admin`` is not ``True``, or this
            app was already mounted once.

    Edge cases:
        - Exactly one WARNING is logged at mount time, naming the
          trade-off, the role, and the prefix.
        - Underprivileged/unauthenticated calls are 403, never 500.
        - There is no environment-variable path to this function — the DSN
          alone (``VARCO_TENANCY_ADMIN_DSN``) mounts nothing.
