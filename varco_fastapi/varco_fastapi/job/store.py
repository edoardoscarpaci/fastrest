varco_fastapi.job.store
========================
In-memory implementation of ``AbstractJobStore``.

``InMemoryJobStore`` backs jobs with a plain ``dict`` protected by a lazily
created ``asyncio.Lock``.  All state is lost on process restart — suitable for
development, testing, and single-process deployments where jobs complete within
the process lifetime.

For durable job storage, use backend-specific implementations (e.g.
``SaJobStore`` in ``varco_sa`` or ``RedisJobStore`` in ``varco_redis``).

DESIGN: dict + lazy lock over asyncio.Queue or third-party job library
    ✅ No external dependencies — works out of the box
    ✅ Lazy lock creation avoids "no running event loop" at module import
    ✅ O(1) get/save by UUID
    ✅ Easy to inspect in tests — just read store._jobs
    ❌ No persistence — all jobs lost on restart
    ❌ No cross-process visibility — only meaningful in single-process deployments

Thread safety:  ✅ All mutations protected by asyncio.Lock.
Async safety:   ✅ Lock is created lazily inside the running event loop.
