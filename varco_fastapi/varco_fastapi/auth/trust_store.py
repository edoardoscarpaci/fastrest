varco_fastapi.auth.trust_store
==============================

⚠️ DEPRECATED (Plan 026 / T3c, §D-T3-oq1) — removed in 4.0.0.

``varco_fastapi.auth.trust_store.TrustStore`` is now a thin subclass of
``varco_core.tls.TrustStore`` that **pins its 3.0 semantics** (non-recursive folder scan,
``("*.pem", "*.crt")`` cert patterns, deferred mTLS-pairing validation) so every existing
construction of this type keeps producing a byte-identical ``ssl.SSLContext`` after upgrading
to 3.1 — zero behaviour change for any config expressible in 3.0.

**Migrate to** ``varco_core.tls.TrustStore`` — it is recursive by default, globs a wider
cert-file set (``varco_core.tls.CERT_FILE_PATTERNS``), validates mTLS pairing eagerly at
construction, and is reachable from any backend (not just ``varco_fastapi``). Pair it with
``varco_core.tls.ReloadingTrustStore`` for hot reload.

DESIGN: subclass over a plain re-export alias (§D-T3-oq1)
    ✅ A plain alias is not available here — unlike AB-1 (``render_rls_ddl``) and AB-2
       (``SchemaMigrationError``), the old and new names do **not** denote the same
       behaviour: the new type is recursive by default and globs ``*.cer`` too. Aliasing
       would silently give every existing ``varco_fastapi.auth.TrustStore`` user recursive,
       wider cert discovery on upgrade — precisely what the locked "Cert search" decision
       (``BACKLOG.md:30``) exists to prevent.
    ✅ ``include_system_cas`` semantics are preserved *by construction*: the field lives on
       the base class with the same default and the same meaning.
    ✅ The api-surface snapshot records a class's *defining module*
       (``design/api-freeze-and-standards/measurements/api-surface.md``). A subclass keeps
       that module unchanged — the ``varco_fastapi`` entry does not move at all; only a new
       ``varco_core`` row is added, a non-failing note. ``api_surface.py --check`` stays green.
    ❌ **The asymmetry**: ``isinstance(core_store, varco_fastapi.auth.TrustStore)`` is
       ``False``. A user who constructs the *new* type and passes it to their own function
       that ``isinstance``-checks the *old* one will get a surprise. Mitigation: no code in
       this repo does such a check on the legacy type
       (``varco_fastapi/tests/test_http_connection.py:110`` checks ``isinstance(ts,
       TrustStore)`` where ``TrustStore`` is this very legacy alias and ``ts`` comes from
       ``HttpConnectionSettings.to_trust_store()``, which by design still returns a legacy
       instance — see §D-T3-bridge — so that check keeps passing unchanged), and the
       ``DeprecationWarning`` tells the user to stop importing the old name.
    ❌ Two live classes instead of one until 4.0.0. Accepted — that is what a deprecation
       window is.

The ``DeprecationWarning`` fires **at construction**, not at import — merely having
``from varco_fastapi import TrustStore`` at a module's top does not warn.

Thread safety:  ✅ ``frozen=True`` — immutable after construction, same as the base class.
Async safety:   ✅ ``build_ssl_context()`` is synchronous, same as the base class.

    ⚠️ Deprecated — use ``varco_core.tls.TrustStore`` instead. Removed in 4.0.0.

    TLS trust configuration — merges system CAs, env-configured cert folders, explicit CA
    certs, and optional mTLS client identity. This subclass pins the exact behaviour this
    type had in 3.0: non-recursive cert-folder scanning, ``("*.pem", "*.crt")`` patterns, and
    a partial-mTLS check deferred to ``build_ssl_context()`` (not eager at construction, unlike
    the base ``varco_core.tls.TrustStore``).

    Attributes:
        ca_cert:            Explicit CA PEM bytes or path to PEM file (inherited).
        ca_folder:          Directory of ``*.pem`` / ``*.crt`` files to merge with the CA
                            trust chain — the 3.0 field name, singular. Internally folded
                            into the inherited ``ca_folders`` tuple in ``__post_init__`` so
                            ``build_ssl_context()`` (inherited from the base class, unchanged)
                            loads it exactly as before.
        client_cert:        Path to mTLS client certificate file (inherited).
        client_key:         Path to mTLS client private key file (inherited).
        include_system_cas: Whether to include the OS CA bundle (inherited).

    Thread safety:  ✅ frozen=True — safe to share across threads.
    Async safety:   ✅ ``build_ssl_context()`` is synchronous.

    Edge cases:
        - ``TrustStore()`` (default) → system CA bundle only.
        - ``include_system_cas=False`` with ``ca_cert=None`` and no ``ca_folder`` creates an
          empty CA store — all TLS connections will fail. Use only for strict pinning.
        - ``client_cert``/``client_key`` partial config does **not** raise at construction
          (unlike the base class) — it raises in ``build_ssl_context()``, exactly as in 3.0.

    Example::

        # Standard (system CAs only)
        ts = TrustStore()
        ctx = ts.build_ssl_context()

        # With a private CA
        ts = TrustStore(ca_cert=Path("/etc/ssl/my-ca.pem"))

        # From env vars
        ts = TrustStore.from_env()
