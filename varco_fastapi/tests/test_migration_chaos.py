"""
Crashed migration-lock-holder recovery (Plan 018 / RT9 + RT7b, Step 33 —
chaos tier).

The real operational question RT9 leaves unanswered: *"a pod died
mid-migration — is the next deploy wedged forever?"* CLAUDE.md's
held-open-advisory-lock-transaction design says no (there is no ``release()``
call; the lock is released by the holder's own COMMIT, and a dead connection
releases it automatically — the correct failure domain). **Nothing verified
that.**

Mechanism: kill the connection holding the advisory lock with
``pg_terminate_backend`` from a separate connection. That is the closest
in-database analogue of "the pod was OOM-killed", and it is deterministic —
the test controls both the holder and the killer. ``ChaosContainer.restart()``
is the documented fallback if ``pg_terminate_backend`` ever proves flaky
(plan Step 33), which is why this module still owns a chaos container.

Container scope (§chaos-fixture): a **module**-scoped
``postgres_container_chaos`` declared here, never in ``conftest.py``.
``varco_fastapi`` has no shared session-scoped Postgres fixture, but the
convention is held to anyway so the file reads identically to the other
chaos modules.

    A lifespan booted after the previous lock holder's connection was killed
    must acquire the lock and apply the pending revisions — not hang to
    ``lock_timeout``.

    Sequence:
      1. Hold the migration advisory lock from a dedicated connection and
         confirm a boot with a 1 s ``lock_timeout`` cannot get in.
      2. ``pg_terminate_backend`` that connection — the "pod died" moment.
      3. Boot again. It must acquire, apply, and serve.

    Step (1) is the control: without it, step (3) succeeding would prove
    nothing (the lock might never have been held in the first place).

    Edge cases:
        - The database is created fresh so the shipped framework branch has
          genuinely pending revisions; ``AlembicMigrator.upgrade()``
          short-circuits on an empty plan **before** taking the lock, which
          would make the whole test vacuous.
        - ``pg_terminate_backend`` is preferred over a full container restart
          because it kills exactly one backend and leaves the rest of the
          module's container healthy (module scope). ``chaos.restart()`` is
          the documented fallback if it proves flaky.
