==========
Business logic for the patient records entity backed by PostgreSQL.

``PatientService`` extends ``AsyncService[Patient, UUID, PatientCreate,
PatientRead, PatientUpdate]`` and overrides ``_get_repo()`` (the only required
abstract method) to return the ``patient``-keyed repository from the active
unit-of-work.

The service also overrides ``_prepare_for_create()`` to stamp ``created_at``
and ``updated_at`` timestamps before the entity is saved.

DESIGN: timestamp stamping in the service layer, not the assembler
    ✅ The assembler stays pure (no ``datetime.now()`` calls, no UTC imports).
    ✅ Timestamps are available immediately after ``save()`` returns — no
       extra SELECT needed to read server-side ``DEFAULT NOW()``.
    ✅ ``_prepare_for_create`` is called by ``AsyncService.create()`` inside
       the UoW, so timestamps are consistent with the commit time.
    ❌ Timestamps are set in Python, not the DB — millisecond precision
       matches Python's ``datetime.now(UTC)`` resolution (adequate here).

Note on field-level encryption
    Encryption is completely transparent to this service.  The service always
    works with plaintext ``Patient`` objects — the ORM mapper (built by
    ``SAModelFactory.build(Patient, encryptor=...)`` in ``app.py``) handles
    all encrypt-on-write / decrypt-on-read transparently.

Thread safety:  ⚠️ Singleton — methods must be stateless; each call opens
                   its own unit-of-work via ``self._uow_provider.make_uow()``.
Async safety:   ✅ All public methods are ``async def``.
