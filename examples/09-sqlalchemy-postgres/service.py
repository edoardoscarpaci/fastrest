==========
Business logic for the blog post entity backed by PostgreSQL.

``PostService`` extends ``AsyncService[Post, UUID, PostCreate, PostRead, PostUpdate]``
and overrides ``_get_repo()`` (the only required abstract method) to return the
``post``-keyed repository from the active unit-of-work.

The service also overrides ``_prepare_for_create()`` to stamp ``created_at``
and ``updated_at`` timestamps before the entity is saved.  Without this, both
fields would be ``None`` in the database — the SA column type is nullable
(``FieldHint(nullable=True)``), but the ``PostRead`` DTO expects real datetimes.

DESIGN: timestamp stamping in the service layer, not the assembler
    ✅ The assembler stays pure (no ``datetime.now()`` calls, no UTC imports).
    ✅ Timestamps are available immediately after ``save()`` returns — no
       extra SELECT needed to read server-side ``DEFAULT NOW()``.
    ✅ ``_prepare_for_create`` is called by ``AsyncService.create()`` inside
       the UoW, so timestamps are consistent with the commit time.
    ❌ Timestamps are set in Python, not the DB — millisecond precision
       matches Python's ``datetime.now(UTC)`` resolution (adequate here).

Thread safety:  ⚠️ Singleton — methods must be stateless; each call opens
                   its own unit-of-work via ``self._uow_provider.make_uow()``.
Async safety:   ✅ All public methods are ``async def``.
