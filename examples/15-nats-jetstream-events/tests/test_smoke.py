"""
test_smoke.py
=============
Integration smoke tests for the ``15-nats-jetstream-events`` example.

All tests require a running NATS server with JetStream enabled and are tagged
``@pytest.mark.integration``.  Run them with::

    pytest -m integration examples/15-nats-jetstream-events/tests/

The ``nats_url`` fixture spins up a real NATS container via testcontainers
with JetStream enabled (``-js`` flag) and yields the connection URL.

The ``bus_and_consumer`` fixture starts ``NatsEventBus`` explicitly (because
``httpx.ASGITransport`` does NOT trigger ASGI lifespan) and passes the
pre-started bus into ``create_app``.

DESIGN: pre-start bus in the fixture, pass to create_app
    ✅ Avoids the ASGITransport-lifespan problem without any workaround.
    ✅ The fixture fully controls bus lifetime — ``stop()`` is guaranteed
       in the ``finally`` block even if tests fail.
    ✅ Tests can inspect ``consumer.received`` directly without touching
       request state.
    ❌ Tests must wait for JetStream delivery (polling loop) — NATS JetStream
       is asynchronous; there is no synchronous ack from the consumer side.

Thread safety:  ❌  Single asyncio event loop; no concurrent test execution.
Async safety:   ✅  All test functions are ``async def``.

    Start a NATS 2.10 container with JetStream enabled and yield the URL.

    Scope is ``"session"`` — the container is shared across all tests to avoid
    the ~2 s startup overhead per test.

    The ``-js`` flag passed to the NATS server command enables JetStream;
    without it, ``NatsEventBus.start()`` would fail when trying to access the
    JetStream context.

    Yields:
        NATS connection URL string, e.g. ``"nats://127.0.0.1:32768"``.

    Edge cases:
        - Requires Docker daemon to be running.
        - Uses port 4222 inside the container; the host port is ephemeral
          (assigned by Docker).
        - ``wait_for_logs`` polls until the "Server is ready" log line
          appears — fails if NATS does not start within 30 s.

async def bus_and_consumer(nats_url):

    Pre-start a ``NatsEventBus`` and build an ``OrderConsumer``.

    Yields the tuple ``(bus, consumer)`` with the bus already started.
    The caller (``client`` fixture) attaches the bus to ``create_app`` so
    the lifespan does NOT start/stop it — this fixture owns the lifecycle.

    Each test gets a **fresh consumer** (``received`` list starts empty) via
    function scope, but reuses the same NATS container (session scope).
    A unique ``durable_name`` per fixture invocation prevents JetStream
    consumer state from leaking between tests.

    Yields:
        Tuple of ``(NatsEventBus, OrderConsumer)`` — both ready to use.

    Edge cases:
        - Subscriptions from ``consumer._setup()`` are registered on the
          bus before ``start()`` is called.  ``start()`` then creates the
          durable JetStream consumer and begins receiving messages.
        - ``stop()`` is called in the ``finally`` block — guaranteed even
          on test failure.
        - Each invocation gets a unique ``durable_name`` to avoid the
          JetStream "consumer already exists with different config" error
          when tests create consumers for the same channel with different
          settings.

    Poll ``consumer.received`` until ``count`` events arrive or ``timeout`` expires.

    NATS JetStream delivery is asynchronous — there is no synchronous
    acknowledgement from the consumer side.  This helper replaces a fixed
    ``asyncio.sleep`` with a short-polling loop, making tests faster and
    more deterministic.

    JetStream ack round-trips are slightly slower than Redis Pub/Sub, so the
    default timeout and poll interval are more generous than the Redis example.

    Args:
        consumer:      The ``OrderConsumer`` whose ``received`` list to check.
        count:         Minimum number of events to wait for.
        timeout:       Maximum seconds to wait before failing (default 5 s).
        poll_interval: Seconds between each poll (default 0.1 s).

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If ``count`` events do not arrive within ``timeout``.

    Edge cases:
        - If events arrive faster than ``poll_interval``, the loop exits early.
        - ``timeout`` is a best-effort wall-clock bound; asyncio scheduling
          may add a small additional delay.
