=======
Document service with grant-based and ownership-based authorization.

This module shows authorization enforced **at the service layer** using:

1. ``GrantBasedAuthorizer`` — checks JWT-embedded ``ResourceGrant``s for
   CREATE/LIST operations (type-level key ``"documents"``).
2. ``OwnershipAuthorizer`` — checks ``entity.owner_id == ctx.user_id`` for
   DELETE operations (instance-level ownership).
3. Service hooks:
   - ``_prepare_for_create`` — stamps ``owner_id`` from ``ctx.user_id``.
   - ``_check_entity`` — blocks READ/DELETE for non-owners without admin role.

DESIGN: combined authorizer (GrantBased + Ownership) via subclassing
    We compose both checks in a single ``DocumentAuthorizer`` class rather
    than chaining two separate DI bindings:

    ✅ Explicit dispatch — easy to read which rule applies to which action.
    ✅ Single DI binding — no need to register two authorizers and hope
       they compose.
    ✅ Admin override is inline — ``ctx.has_role("admin")`` checked before
       ownership, so admins can always act regardless of ownership.
    ❌ Less reusable than mixing in pre-built authorizers — acceptable here
       because the composition logic is the point of the example.

DESIGN: ownership check in ``_check_entity`` rather than ``authorize``
    The authorizer's ``authorize()`` is called by the service AFTER
    ``_check_entity``.  For DELETE, we raise ``ServiceNotFoundError`` (not
    ``ServiceAuthorizationError``) in ``_check_entity`` when the caller is
    neither the owner nor an admin.  This prevents existence oracles — a
    non-owner gets a 404 (entity doesn't exist from their perspective), not
    a 403 (entity exists but you're not allowed).

    ✅ Prevents existence-oracle attacks — attacker cannot distinguish
       "not found" from "found but not yours".
    ✅ Consistent with varco's ``_check_entity`` contract (raise
       ``ServiceNotFoundError``, never ``ServiceAuthorizationError``).
    ❌ Callers may be confused by 404 when the document exists but isn't
       theirs — a deliberate security trade-off.

Thread safety:  ⚠️ Singleton — must be stateless.
Async safety:   ✅ All public methods are ``async def``.

class DocumentAuthorizer(GrantBasedAuthorizer):
    """
    Combined grant-based and ownership authorizer for ``Document`` entities.

    Authorization rules:
        CREATE: caller must have ``docs:write`` grant in their JWT.
        LIST:   caller must have ``docs:read`` grant in their JWT.
        READ:   caller must have ``docs:read`` grant (type-level is enough).
        DELETE: owner OR admin role (checked via ``_check_entity`` in the
                service, not here — see module docstring for rationale).

    Registered as a ``@Singleton`` at default priority (0), which shadows the
    permissive ``BaseAuthorizer`` at priority ``-(2**31)``.

    DESIGN: inherits ``GrantBasedAuthorizer`` for the core grant check
        ``GrantBasedAuthorizer.authorize()`` calls ``ctx.can(action, key)``
        where the key is derived from the entity type + optional instance pk.
        We override ``_resource_key`` to use ``"documents"`` (type-level)
        for all operations — instance-level ACL is handled by ownership in
        ``_check_entity``.

        ✅ Reuses the battle-tested ``GrantBasedAuthorizer`` logic.
        ✅ Admin bypass: a ``ResourceGrant("*", frozenset(Action))`` in the
           JWT grants everything, including CREATE — no special-casing needed.
        ❌ No instance-level grant support (e.g. ``"documents:abc123"`` for
           READ) — this example uses ownership instead for simplicity.

    Thread safety:  ✅ Stateless after construction — no mutable state.
    Async safety:   ✅ ``authorize`` reads only the frozen ``AuthContext``.
