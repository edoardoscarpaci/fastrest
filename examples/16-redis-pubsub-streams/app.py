======
Application factory for the Redis Pub/Sub & Streams notification-hub example.

``create_app(redis_url)`` returns a FastAPI application wired with:

- ``RedisEventBus``         — pub/sub bus (at-most-once delivery)
- ``BusEventProducer``      — publishes events without exposing the bus
- ``OrderConsumer``         — listens to ``OrderPlacedEvent`` on ``"orders"``
- ``build_router``          — HTTP endpoints for orders + notifications

Lifecycle
---------
``RedisEventBus`` requires ``start()``/``stop()`` around the ASGI lifecycle.
In production the ``lifespan`` context manager handles this automatically.

In tests, ``httpx.ASGITransport`` does NOT trigger the FastAPI lifespan, so
``create_app`` accepts a pre-started ``bus`` argument — the test fixture owns
the lifecycle and passes the live bus in directly.  This avoids the need for
any lifespan workaround in test code.

DESIGN: accept pre-built bus for test isolation
    ✅ Eliminates the ASGITransport-lifespan problem (see FINDINGS F06).
    ✅ ``create_app(redis_url)`` is the simple production path.
    ✅ Tests pass a live bus; production just passes the URL.
    ❌ Not DI-wired — intentional for a focused event-bus example.

Usage::

    from app import create_app
    app = create_app("redis://localhost:6379/0")
    # uvicorn app:app

Thread safety:  ❌  Single event loop.
Async safety:   ✅  Lifespan context manages bus start/stop.

    Create and return a configured FastAPI application.

    When ``bus`` is ``None`` (production), a new ``RedisEventBus`` is
    constructed from ``redis_url`` and started/stopped inside the ASGI
    ``lifespan``.  When ``bus`` is provided (tests), the lifespan does NOT
    touch it — the caller owns the lifecycle.

    Args:
        redis_url: Redis connection URL (e.g. ``"redis://localhost:6379/0"``).
                   Only used when ``bus`` is ``None``.
        bus:       Pre-started ``AbstractEventBus``.  When provided, the
                   lifespan skips ``start()``/``stop()``.  Pass this from
                   test fixtures to avoid relying on the ASGI lifespan.

    Returns:
        A ``FastAPI`` instance ready to serve requests.

    DESIGN: optional pre-built bus argument
        ``ASGITransport`` used in tests does NOT trigger FastAPI lifespan,
        so the bus would never be started if we created it inside lifespan
        only.  Accepting a pre-started bus lets tests manage the lifecycle
        themselves (see F06 in FINDINGS.md).

    Edge cases:
        - If ``bus`` is ``None`` and Redis is unreachable, ``bus.start()``
          raises ``ConnectionError`` during the ASGI lifespan — FastAPI
          propagates this as a startup error.
        - The ``OrderConsumer`` calls ``_setup()`` (i.e. ``register_to()``)
          immediately after construction so subscriptions are active before
          the first request is served.
