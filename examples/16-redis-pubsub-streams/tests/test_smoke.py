"""
test_smoke.py
=============
Integration smoke tests for the ``16-redis-pubsub-streams`` example.

All tests require a running Redis instance and are tagged
``@pytest.mark.integration``.  Run them with::

    pytest -m integration examples/16-redis-pubsub-streams/tests/

The ``redis_url`` fixture spins up a real Redis container via testcontainers
and yields the connection URL.  The ``client`` fixture starts ``RedisEventBus``
explicitly (because ``httpx.ASGITransport`` does NOT trigger ASGI lifespan —
see FINDINGS F06) and passes the pre-started bus into ``create_app``.

DESIGN: pre-start bus in the fixture, pass to create_app
    ✅ Avoids the ASGITransport-lifespan problem without any workaround.
    ✅ The fixture fully controls bus lifetime — ``stop()`` is guaranteed
       in the ``finally`` block even if tests fail.
    ✅ Tests can inspect ``consumer.received`` directly without touching
       request state.
    ❌ Tests must wait for Pub/Sub delivery (``asyncio.sleep``) — Redis
       Pub/Sub is asynchronous; there is no synchronous ack.

Thread safety:  ❌  Single asyncio event loop; no concurrent test execution.
Async safety:   ✅  All test functions are ``async def``.

    Start a Redis 7 container and yield the connection URL.

    Scope is ``"session"`` — the container is shared across all tests to avoid
    the ~2 s startup overhead per test.

    Yields:
        Redis connection URL string, e.g. ``"redis://127.0.0.1:32768/0"``.

    Edge cases:

    the lifespan does NOT start/stop it — this fixture owns the lifecycle.

    Yields:
        Tuple of ``(RedisEventBus, OrderConsumer)`` — both ready to use.

    Edge cases:
        - Subscriptions from ``consumer._setup()`` are registered on the
          bus before ``start()`` is called.  ``start()`` then subscribes
          to the matching Redis channels immediately.
