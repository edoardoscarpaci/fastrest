test_smoke.py
=============
Integration smoke tests for the ``14-kafka-order-events`` example.

All tests require a running Kafka broker and are tagged
``@pytest.mark.integration``.  Run them with::

    pytest -m integration examples/14-kafka-order-events/tests/

The ``kafka_servers`` fixture spins up a real Kafka container via
testcontainers and yields the bootstrap servers string.  The ``bus_and_consumer``
fixture starts ``KafkaEventBus`` explicitly (because ``httpx.ASGITransport``
does NOT trigger ASGI lifespan — see FINDINGS F06) and passes the pre-started
bus into ``create_app``.

DESIGN: pre-start bus in the fixture, pass to create_app
    ✅ Avoids the ASGITransport-lifespan problem without any workaround.
    ✅ The fixture fully controls bus lifetime — ``stop()`` is guaranteed
       in the ``finally`` block even if tests fail.
    ✅ Tests can inspect ``consumer.received`` directly without touching
       request state.
    ❌ Tests must wait for Kafka message delivery — Kafka consumer group
       coordination is asynchronous.  We use a short polling loop instead
       of a fixed sleep to keep tests fast.

DESIGN: unique consumer group ID per fixture invocation
    ✅ Prevents offset interference between tests — each test's consumer
       starts fresh, not from where the previous test left off.
    ✅ ``auto_offset_reset="earliest"`` ensures messages published before
       the consumer fully joined are still received.
    ❌ Orphaned consumer groups accumulate in the broker during the test run.
       For production Kafka, clean up groups; for testcontainers this is fine
       since the container is destroyed after the session.

Thread safety:  ❌  Single asyncio event loop; no concurrent test execution.
Async safety:   ✅  All test functions are ``async def``.

    Start a Kafka broker container and yield the bootstrap servers string.

    Scope is ``"session"`` — the container is shared across all tests to avoid
    the ~10 s startup overhead per test.  The ``confluentinc/cp-kafka`` image
    is used because it starts reliably without requiring ZooKeeper in KRaft mode.

    Yields:
        Bootstrap servers string, e.g. ``"127.0.0.1:32768"``.

    Edge cases:
        - Requires Docker daemon to be running.
        - First run downloads the image (~500 MB); subsequent runs use cache.

    Pre-start a ``KafkaEventBus`` and build an ``OrderConsumer``.

    Creates a fresh consumer group per invocation (unique UUID suffix) so
    tests don't share Kafka offsets.  ``auto_offset_reset="earliest"`` ensures
    messages published just before the consumer joined are still received.

    Yields the tuple ``(bus, consumer)`` with the bus already started.
    The caller (``client`` fixture) attaches the bus to ``create_app`` so
    the lifespan does NOT start/stop it — this fixture owns the lifecycle.

    Yields:
        Tuple of ``(KafkaEventBus, OrderConsumer)`` — both ready to use.

    Edge cases:
        - ``consumer._setup()`` is called before ``bus.start()`` — subscriptions
          are registered on the bus object, and ``start()`` creates the Kafka
          consumer for those topics.
        - ``stop()`` is called in the ``finally`` block — guaranteed even
          on test failure.
        - Kafka consumer group formation takes a few hundred milliseconds
          after ``start()``.  Use ``_wait_for_notifications()`` rather than
          fixed sleeps.

    Poll ``consumer.received`` until ``count`` events arrive or ``timeout`` expires.

    Kafka delivery is asynchronous — consumer group formation and message
    dispatch add latency vs Redis Pub/Sub.  This helper replaces a fixed
    ``asyncio.sleep`` with a short-polling loop, making tests faster and more
    deterministic.

    Args:
        consumer:      The ``OrderConsumer`` whose ``received`` list to check.

        timeout:       Maximum seconds to wait before failing.  Default 5 s
