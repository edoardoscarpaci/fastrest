======
Application factory for the Kafka order-events example.

``create_app(bootstrap_servers)`` returns a FastAPI application wired with:

- ``KafkaEventBus``         — durable Kafka-backed bus (at-least-once delivery)
- ``BusEventProducer``      — publishes events without exposing the bus
- ``OrderConsumer``         — listens to ``OrderPlacedEvent`` on ``"orders"``
- ``build_router``          — HTTP endpoints for orders + notifications

Lifecycle
---------
``KafkaEventBus`` requires ``start()``/``stop()`` around the ASGI lifecycle.
In production the ``lifespan`` context manager handles this automatically.

In tests, ``httpx.ASGITransport`` does NOT trigger the FastAPI lifespan, so
``create_app`` accepts a pre-started ``bus`` argument — the test fixture owns
the lifecycle and passes the live bus in directly.  This avoids the need for
any lifespan workaround in test code.

Key difference from the Redis example (16)
------------------------------------------
Kafka delivers at-least-once — messages are persisted to the broker and
replayed after consumer restarts.  The consumer uses ``auto_offset_reset``
to control where it starts reading.  Tests use ``"earliest"`` so messages
published before the consumer fully joined are still received.

DESIGN: accept pre-built bus for test isolation
    ✅ Eliminates the ASGITransport-lifespan problem (see FINDINGS F06).
    ✅ ``create_app(bootstrap_servers)`` is the simple production path.
    ✅ Tests pass a live bus; production just passes the broker address.
    ❌ Not DI-wired — intentional for a focused event-bus example.

Usage::

    from app import create_app
    app = create_app("localhost:9092")
    # uvicorn app:app

Thread safety:  ❌  Single event loop.
Async safety:   ✅  Lifespan context manages bus start/stop.

    Create and return a configured FastAPI application.

    When ``bus`` is ``None`` (production), a new ``KafkaEventBus`` is
    constructed from ``bootstrap_servers`` and started/stopped inside the ASGI
    ``lifespan``.  When ``bus`` is provided (tests), the lifespan does NOT
    touch it — the caller owns the lifecycle.

    Args:
        bootstrap_servers: Comma-separated Kafka broker addresses
                           (e.g. ``"localhost:9092"``).  Only used when
                           ``bus`` is ``None``.
        bus:               Pre-started ``AbstractEventBus``.  When provided,
                           the lifespan skips ``start()``/``stop()``.  Pass
                           this from test fixtures to avoid relying on the
                           ASGI lifespan.

    Returns:
        A ``FastAPI`` instance ready to serve requests.

    DESIGN: optional pre-built bus argument
        ``ASGITransport`` used in tests does NOT trigger FastAPI lifespan,
        so the bus would never be started if we created it inside lifespan
        only.  Accepting a pre-started bus lets tests manage the lifecycle
        themselves (see F06 in FINDINGS.md).

    Edge cases:
        - If ``bus`` is ``None`` and Kafka is unreachable, ``bus.start()``
          raises during the ASGI lifespan — FastAPI propagates this as a
          startup error.
        - The ``OrderConsumer`` calls ``_setup()`` (i.e. ``register_to()``)
          immediately after construction so subscriptions are active before
          the first request is served.
        - Kafka consumer group formation may take a few hundred milliseconds
          after ``start()`` — in production this is negligible, but tests
          must wait for the consumer to receive messages (see test fixtures).
