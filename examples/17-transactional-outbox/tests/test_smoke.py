=============
Integration smoke tests for the ``17-transactional-outbox`` example.

All tests require a running PostgreSQL instance — tagged ``pytest.mark.integration``
and skipped by default.  Run with::

    uv run pytest examples/17-transactional-outbox/tests/ -v -m integration

What these tests verify
-----------------------
1. **Create order returns 202** — ``POST /v1/orders`` succeeds and creates a
   row in both the ``orders`` and ``varco_outbox`` tables atomically.

2. **OutboxRelay delivers the event** — after a short wait, ``GET /v1/events``
   shows the ``OrderCreatedEvent`` received by ``OrderConsumer``.

3. **Deduplication skips replays** — calling the relay's poll cycle again does
   not add duplicate events to ``consumer.received`` because the outbox row is
   deleted after first delivery.

4. **GET /health returns 200** — basic liveness check.

DESIGN: session-scoped app and Postgres container
    ✅ One container + one ``create_app()`` call shared across all tests.
    ✅ Tests are additive — each creates its own records and asserts only on
       those records; empty-DB assumption is avoided.
    ✅ The FastAPI lifespan (DDL + relay start/stop) is invoked explicitly via
       ``httpx.AsyncClient(lifespan="auto")`` which DOES trigger lifespan in
       httpx 0.25+.  This avoids the ``ASGITransport`` no-lifespan problem.
    ❌ The relay runs with ``poll_interval=0.1`` s — tests wait up to 2 s for
       delivery.  Very fast but not instant.

Thread safety:  ❌ Single event loop.
Async safety:   ✅ All test functions are ``async def``.
