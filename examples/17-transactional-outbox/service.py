==========
Business logic for the order entity with transactional outbox integration.

``OrderService`` overrides ``create()`` to write both the ``Order`` row and
an ``OutboxEntry`` within a single DB transaction.  The ``OutboxRelay``
background task reads pending outbox entries and publishes them to the event
bus — decoupling event delivery from the HTTP request lifecycle.

DESIGN: override create() for outbox write — not a service hook
    ``AsyncService._prepare_for_create()`` runs before ``repo.save()``, but
    the outbox entry needs the ``pk`` from the saved entity.  Overriding the
    full ``create()`` method and calling ``repo.save()`` first, then writing
    the outbox entry in the same session, is the cleanest pattern.

    ✅ Both rows share the same ``AsyncSession`` — commit is atomic.
    ✅ If the broker is down, the outbox entry stays in the DB; the relay
       retries on next poll.
    ✅ ``OutboxRelay`` is the ONLY consumer of ``AbstractEventBus`` outside
       of ``EventConsumer.register_to()`` — the service never holds the bus.
    ❌ Manual ``create()`` override duplicates some ``AsyncService`` boilerplate.
       In production, extract a ``TransactionalOutboxMixin``.

DESIGN: SAOutboxRepository injected from the service
    The ``SAOutboxRepository`` is session-scoped — it must use the SAME
    ``AsyncSession`` as the ``SQLAlchemyUnitOfWork`` to participate in the
    same transaction.  The session is accessed via ``uow.session``.

    ✅ Single DB roundtrip: order + outbox entry committed together.
    ✅ No second UoW needed for the outbox — same session.
    ❌ Couples the service to the SA implementation detail (``uow.session``).
       In production, expose an ``OutboxRepository`` from the UoW directly.

Thread safety:  ⚠️ Singleton service — each call opens its own UoW.
Async safety:   ✅ All methods are ``async def``.

        Create a new order and save an ``OutboxEntry`` in the same DB transaction.

        Overrides the base ``create()`` to write the outbox entry atomically
        with the domain entity.  The ``OutboxRelay`` background task picks up
        the entry and publishes ``OrderCreatedEvent`` to the bus.

        Steps:
        1. Open a ``SQLAlchemyUnitOfWork``.
        2. Assemble ``Order`` from ``dto`` via the injected assembler.
        3. Save ``Order`` (generates ``pk`` on INSERT).

           saved ``pk``.
        5. Save the outbox entry via ``SAOutboxRepository`` using the SAME

            ctx: Caller's identity and grants.

        Returns:

        Raises:
            ServiceAuthorizationError: Authorization check fails (unlikely —
                                       ``BaseAuthorizer`` is permissive).

        Edge cases:
            - If ``repo.save()`` raises (DB error), the UoW rolls back and
              NO outbox entry is written — both rows are atomic.
            - If the relay publishes the event but crashes before deleting the
              outbox entry, the entry will be replayed on the next relay tick.
              Consumers should use ``SADeduplicator`` to handle duplicates.
