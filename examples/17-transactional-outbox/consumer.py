===========
Event consumer for ``OrderCreatedEvent`` in the transactional-outbox example.

``OrderConsumer`` subscribes to ``OrderCreatedEvent`` on the ``"orders"``
channel.  Received events are appended to ``received`` — an in-memory list
that the HTTP handler exposes for inspection.

Deduplication
-------------
``SADeduplicator`` is wired into the ``@listen`` decorator via ``deduplicator=``.
The relay may deliver the same outbox entry more than once (e.g., if the process
crashes between ``bus.publish()`` and the ``delete()`` call).  The deduplicator
checks whether the event's ``event_id`` was seen recently and skips duplicates
within the configured TTL window.

DESIGN: SADeduplicator on @listen vs in the handler body
    ✅ The decorator wiring is declarative — the deduplication window is
       visible at class-definition time, not buried in handler logic.
    ✅ Duplicate events never reach ``on_order`` — cleaner handler code.
    ❌ The deduplicator needs a DB connection (``AsyncEngine``), which means
       the consumer is no longer fully in-memory.  Acceptable for this example.

DESIGN: in-memory notification list over a database
    ✅ Keeps the consumer simple — tests can assert on ``received`` directly.
    ❌ State is lost on restart.  In production, persist notifications.

Thread safety:  ❌ Not thread-safe — single asyncio event loop assumed.
Async safety:   ✅ Handler is ``async def``; list.append() is GIL-safe.
