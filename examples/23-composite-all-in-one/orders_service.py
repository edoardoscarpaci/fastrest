"""
orders_service
==============
A minimal standalone varco service standing in for a real microservice.

In a real deployment this would be its own package with its own
``create_varco_app()`` call, its own ``DIContainer``, and its own database.
Here it is intentionally tiny — a single ``GenericRouter`` route plus a
config value read from the environment — so the example stays focused on the
*composition*, not on any one service's internals.

The ``ORDERS_DB_URL`` read in ``create_orders_app`` demonstrates per-service
configuration: when combined via ``build_service`` (see ``composite.py``), each
service is built under its own scoped environment.
