service
=======
Document service wired with Casbin RBAC authorization.

``DocumentService`` extends ``AsyncService`` with a thin override of
``_get_repo()`` — all RBAC enforcement is delegated to the injected
``AbstractAuthorizer``, which resolves to ``PolicyEngineAuthorizer``
(bridging ``AsyncService`` → ``CasbinPolicyEngine``) when
``enable_policy_authorizer`` is called during bootstrap.

DESIGN: service is thin — no per-method authorization code
    The Casbin integration lives entirely in ``PolicyEngineAuthorizer`` +
    ``RequestMapper``.  ``DocumentService`` adds no custom ``_check_entity``
    or ``_prepare_for_create`` hooks; the RBAC rules in the engine are the
    sole authorization gate.

    ✅ Authz rules are data (policy store), not code — change them at
       runtime via the REST admin router or ``PolicyManagement`` API.
    ✅ ``DocumentService`` stays domain-focused; no auth logic scattered
       through methods.
    ❌ Fine-grained per-document ownership requires ABAC rules in the
       engine model — beyond the scope of this RBAC example.

Thread safety:  ⚠️ Singleton — all methods must be stateless.
Async safety:   ✅ All public methods are ``async def``.
