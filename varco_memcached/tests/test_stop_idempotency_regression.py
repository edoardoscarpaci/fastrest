"""
Plan 022 / Phase 4 (RL-8a), Step 21 — repurposed as regression tests.

Step 6's measurement (``design/api-freeze-and-standards/measurements/
predestroy-vs-lifespan.md`` Part 2) found all ten ``stop()`` implementations
idempotent by reading them, and asked for that read to be replaced by a test
before §D-8a2(b) makes the property load-bearing — under the new ``shutdown=``
hook, a component reachable by both ``_stop_all()`` and ``container.ashutdown()``
has ``stop()`` called twice.

``MemcachedCache`` is table row #9 and the worst-affected orphan alongside
``RedisCache``: ``varco_memcached.di.async_bootstrap()`` defaults
``setup_cache=True``, so the *default* path leaves an eagerly-started client
that nothing tears down today.  No server is needed here — ``aiomcache``
connects lazily, so start→stop→stop completes offline.

NOTE: may legitimately pass on arrival — a regression guard, not a red test.

Thread safety:  N/A (unit test)
Async safety:   ✅ every stop() is awaited.
