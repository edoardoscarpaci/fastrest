"""
Pytest configuration for varco_beanie tests.

DESIGN: Beanie Document collection bypass
    Beanie Document.__init__ calls get_pymongo_collection() which raises
    CollectionWasNotInitialized unless init_beanie() has been called against
    a real MongoDB.  Unit tests bypass this by patching the classmethod to
    return a MagicMock — by the time the check runs (line 209 of documents.py),
    Pydantic has already committed all field values, so attribute assertions
    remain valid.

    Tradeoffs:
        ✅ No MongoDB connection required — tests run in any CI environment
        ✅ Field values are set correctly — Pydantic runs before the check
        ❌ Does not verify MongoDB-level constraints (e.g., index enforcement)
        Alternative: run against a real motor/mongo — better for integration
                     tests, too heavy for unit tests.

Thread safety:  ✅ — monkeypatch is scoped to each test function
Async safety:   ✅ — no async code involved in this fixture

# ``VARCO_TEST_MONGO_URL`` overrides the container entirely (Open Question 1)

    Patch the Document collection accessor so unit tests don't need MongoDB.

    Beanie's Document.__init__ calls a collection accessor classmethod which
    raises CollectionWasNotInitialized if init_beanie() was never called.
    Patching it to return a MagicMock lets Documents be instantiated in unit
    tests without a real database connection.

    The method name varies by beanie version:
        - beanie 2.x:       get_pymongo_collection  (motor dropped)
        - beanie 1.27–1.30: get_motor_collection
    This fixture tries both names so it works across versions without pinning.

    Args:
        request:     pytest's request fixture — used to detect integration
                     markers so the bypass is skipped for those tests.
        monkeypatch: pytest's monkeypatch fixture — automatically scoped to
                     the current test function, so the patch is reversed after
                     each test.

    Edge cases:
        - Tests marked with ``@pytest.mark.integration`` skip this bypass
          because they use a real MongoDB container and call init_beanie().
        - If neither accessor method exists, the bypass is silently skipped —
          the test will fail naturally if a collection operation is triggered.
